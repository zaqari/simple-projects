Chapters 1–4,"Chapters 1–4 Summary: Chapters 1–2 
 The news that a wealthy young gentleman named Charles
Bingley has rented the manor known as Netherfield Park causes a
great stir in the neighboring village of Longbourn, especially in
the Bennet household. The Bennets have five unmarried daughters,
and Mrs. Bennet, a foolish and fussy gossip, is the sort who agrees
with the novel’s opening words: “It is a truth universally acknowledged,
that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want
of a wife.” She sees Bingley’s arrival as an opportunity for one
of the girls to obtain a wealthy spouse, and she therefore insists
that her husband call on the new arrival immediately. Mr. Bennet
torments his family by pretending to have no interest in doing so,
but he eventually meets with Mr. Bingley without their knowing.
When he reveals to Mrs. Bennet and his daughters that he has made
their new neighbor’s acquaintance, they are overjoyed and excited. Summary: Chapters 3–4 
 Eager to learn more, Mrs. Bennet and the girls question
Mr. Bennet incessantly. A few days later, Mr. Bingley returns the
visit, though he does not meet Mr. Bennet’s daughters. The Bennets
invite him to dinner shortly afterward, but he is called away to
London. Soon, however, he returns to Netherfield Park with his two
sisters, his brother-in-law, and a friend named Darcy. Mr. Bingley and his guests go to a ball in the nearby
town of Meryton. The Bennet sisters attend the ball with their mother.
The eldest daughter, Jane, dances twice with Bingley. Within Elizabeth’s hearing,
Bingley exclaims to Darcy that Jane is “the most beautiful creature”
he has ever beheld. Bingley suggests that Darcy dance with Elizabeth,
but Darcy refuses, saying, “she is tolerable, but not handsome enough
to tempt me.” He proceeds to declare that he has no interest in
women who are “slighted by other men.” Elizabeth takes an immediate
and understandable disliking to Darcy. Because of Darcy’s comments
and refusal to dance with anyone not rich and well bred, the neighborhood
takes a similar dislike; it declares Bingley, on the other hand,
to be quite “amiable.” At the end of the evening, the Bennet women return to
their house, where Mrs. Bennet regales her husband with stories
from the evening until he insists that she be silent. Upstairs,
Jane relates to Elizabeth her surprise that Bingley danced with
her twice, and Elizabeth replies that Jane is unaware of her own
beauty. Both girls agree that Bingley’s sisters are not well-mannered,
but whereas Jane insists that they are charming in close conversation,
Elizabeth continues to harbor a dislike for them. The narrator then provides the reader with Bingley’s background:
he inherited a hundred thousand pounds from his father, but for
now, in spite of his sisters’ complaints, he lives as a tenant. His
friendship with Darcy is “steady,” despite the contrast in their characters,
illustrated in their respective reactions to the Meryton ball. Bingley,
cheerful and sociable, has an excellent time and is taken with Jane;
Darcy, more clever but less tactful, finds the people dull and even
criticizes Jane for smiling too often (Bingley’s sisters, on the
other hand, find Jane to be “a sweet girl,” and Bingley therefore
feels secure in his good opinion of her). Analysis: Chapters 1–4 The opening sentence of  "
Chapters 43–45,"Chapters 43–45 Summary: Chapter 43 
 As Elizabeth tours the beautiful estate of Pemberley with
the Gardiners, she imagines what it would be like to be mistress
there, as Darcy’s wife. The housekeeper, Mrs. Reynolds, shows them
portraits of Darcy and Wickham and relates that Darcy, in his youth, was
“the sweetest, most generous-hearted boy in the world.” She adds
that he is the kindest of masters: “I have never had a cross word from
him in my life.” Elizabeth is surprised to hear such an agreeable
description of a man she considers unbearably arrogant. While Elizabeth and the Gardiners continue to explore
the grounds, Darcy himself suddenly appears. He joins them in their walk,
proving remarkably polite. Elizabeth is immediately embarrassed
at having come to Pemberley after the events of recent months, and
she assures Darcy that she came only because she thought that he
was away. Darcy tells her that he has just arrived to prepare his
home for a group of guests that includes the Bingleys and his own
sister, Georgiana. He asks Elizabeth if she would like to meet Georgiana,
and Elizabeth replies that she would. After Darcy leaves them, the
Gardiners comment on his good looks and good manners, so strikingly
divergent from the account of Darcy’s character that Elizabeth has
given them. Summary: Chapters 44–45 The next day, Darcy and Georgiana, who is pretty but very
shy, visit Elizabeth at her inn. Bingley joins them, and after a
brief visit, they invite Elizabeth and the Gardiners, who perceive
that Darcy is in love with their niece, to dine at Pemberley. The
following morning, Elizabeth and Mrs. Gardiner visit Pemberley to
call on Miss Darcy. Bingley’s sisters are both present; when Darcy
enters the room, Miss Bingley makes a spiteful comment to Elizabeth,
noting that the departure of the militia from Meryton “must be a
great loss to your family.” Elizabeth dodges the subject of Wickham.
This deflection proves fortunate given the presence of Georgiana,
as references to the man with whom she almost eloped would embarrass
her. After the guests depart, Miss Bingley attempts to criticize
Elizabeth to Darcy, and makes a light remark about how he once thought Elizabeth
“rather pretty.” Darcy replies that he now considers Elizabeth “one
of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.” Analysis: Chapters 43–45 Elizabeth’s visit to Pemberley constitutes a critical
step in her progress toward marrying Darcy. The house itself is
representative, even a symbol, of its owner—the narrator describes
it as a “large, handsome, stone building, standing well on rising
ground . . . in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled
into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks were
neither formal, nor falsely adorned.” Darcy is similarly large and
handsome, elevated socially just as his house is elevated physically.
The description of the way the stream’s “natural importance was
swelled into greater” reminds the reader of Darcy’s pride; that
the stream is “neither formal, nor falsely adorned,” however, reminds
the reader of Darcy’s honesty and lack of pretense. Most importantly,
the property delights Elizabeth, foreshadowing her eventual realization
that the master of Pemberley similarly delights her. Mrs. Reynolds’s glowing descriptions of Darcy continue
the process of breaking down Elizabeth’s initial prejudice against
him. As Mrs. Reynolds reveals a hidden side of Darcy, Elizabeth
realizes how hastily she has judged him. This ability to admit the
error of her ways demonstrates Elizabeth’s emotional maturity; unlike
Miss Bingley, who resorts to denigrating Elizabeth when she realizes
that Darcy favors her, Elizabeth does not allow arrogance to prevent
her from confronting her own shortcomings. "
Chapters 13–17,"Chapters 13–17 Summary: Chapters 13–15 The morning after his daughters return from Netherfield,
Mr. Bennet informs his wife of an imminent visit from a Mr. William
Collins, who will inherit Mr. Bennet’s property. Mr. Collins, the
reader learns from a letter he sends to the Bennets, is a clergyman
whom the wealthy noblewoman Lady Catherine de Bourgh has recently selected
to serve her parish. His letter, as Mr. Bennet puts it, contains “a
mixture of servility and self-importance,” and his personality is similar.
He arrives at Longbourn and apologizes for being entitled to the
Bennets’ property but spends much of his time admiring and complimenting
the house that will one day be his. At dinner, Mr. Collins lavishes praise on Lady Catherine
de Bourgh and her daughter, a lovely invalid who will one day inherit the
de Bourgh fortune. After the meal, he is asked to read to the girls, but
he refuses to read a novel and reads from a book of sermons instead.
Lydia becomes so bored that she interrupts his reading with more
gossip about the soldiers. Mr. Collins is offended and abandons
the reading, choosing to play backgammon with Mr. Bennet. Mr. Collins is in search of a wife and when Mrs. Bennet
hints that Jane may soon be engaged, he fixes his attention on Elizabeth.
The day after his arrival, he accompanies the sisters to the town
of Meryton, where they encounter one of Lydia’s officer friends,
Mr. Denny. Denny introduces his friend, Mr. Wickham, who has just
joined the militia, and the young women find Wickham charming. While
they converse, Darcy and Bingley happen by, and Elizabeth notices
that Wickham and Darcy are extremely cold to each other. Darcy and Bingley depart, and the company pays a visit
to Mrs. Phillips, Mrs. Bennet’s sister, who invites the Bennets
and Mr. Collins to dine at her house the following night. The girls
convince her to invite Wickham as well. They return home and Mr.
Collins spends the evening telling Mrs. Bennet how greatly her sister’s
good breeding impresses him. Summary: Chapters 16–17 At the Phillips’s dinner party, Wickham proves the center
of attention and Mr. Collins fades into the background. Eventually,
Wickham and Elizabeth find themselves in conversation, and she hears his
story: he had planned on entering the ministry, rather than the militia,
but was unable to do so because he lacked money. Darcy’s father,
Wickham says, had intended to provide for him, but Darcy used a
loophole in the will to keep the money for himself. Elizabeth, who instinctively likes and trusts Wickham,
accepts his story immediately. Later in the evening, while she is
watching Mr. Collins, Wickham tells her that Darcy is Lady Catherine
de Bourgh’s nephew. He describes Lady Catherine as “dictatorial
and insolent.” Elizabeth leaves the party thinking of nothing “but
Mr. Wickham, and what he had told her, all the way home.” She decides that
Darcy deserves nothing but contempt. "
Chapters 46–49,"Chapters 46–49 Summary: Chapter 46 When Elizabeth returns to her inn, she finds
two letters from Jane: the first relates that Lydia has eloped with
Wickham, the second that there is no word from the couple and that
they may not be married yet. Elizabeth panics, realizing that if
Wickham does not marry Lydia, the reputations of both Lydia and
the entire family will be ruined. As Elizabeth rushes out to find the Gardiners, Darcy appears
and she tells him the story. Darcy immediately blames himself for
not exposing Wickham, and Elizabeth blames herself for the same
reason. She decides to return home immediately. After an apology
to Darcy and his sister for breaking their dinner engagement, Elizabeth and
the Gardiners hasten back to the Bennet home in Longbourn. Summary: Chapter 47 On the way home, Mr. Gardiner attempts to reassure his
niece that Wickham will certainly marry Lydia because he will not
want his own career and reputation ruined. Elizabeth replies by
telling them generally about Wickham’s past behavior, without revealing
the details of his romance with Darcy’s sister. When she gets home,
Elizabeth learns that her father has gone to London in search of
Lydia and Wickham. Mrs. Bennet, of course, is hysterical, blaming
Colonel Forster for not taking care of her daughter. In private,
Jane assures Elizabeth that there was no way anyone could have known about
their sister’s attachment to Wickham. Fretfully, they examine the
letter that Lydia left for Colonel Forster’s wife, in which she looks
forward to signing her name “Lydia Wickham.” Summary: Chapter 48 Mr. Gardiner follows Mr. Bennet to London and writes to
Longbourn a few days later with the news that the search has been
unsuccessful so far. He reports that Mr. Bennet is now going to
every hotel in turn looking for the couple. Meanwhile, a letter
arrives from Mr. Collins that, in his usual manner, accuses the
Bennets of poor parenting and notes that Lydia’s behavior reflects
poorly on the family as a whole. More time passes before Mr. Gardiner
writes to say that attempts to trace Wickham through friends and
family have failed. The letter further says, to Mrs. Bennet’s consternation,
that Mr. Bennet is returning home. Summary: Chapter 49 Two days after Mr. Bennet returns to Longbourn, Mr. Gardiner writes
to tell him that Wickham and Lydia have been found and that Wickham
will marry her if the Bennets will guarantee him a small income.
Mr. Bennet gladly acquiesces, deciding that marriage to a scoundrel
is better than a ruined reputation. The Bennets assume that the Gardiners have paid Wickham
a sizable amount to get him to agree to the wedding. Not “a farthing
less than ten thousand pounds,” Mr. Bennet guesses. The Bennets assume
that they owe a deep debt to their relatives. Mrs. Bennet is deliriously
happy at having Lydia married, even when her husband and daughters
point out how much it has probably cost. Her happiness is tempered
when her husband refuses to allow Wickham and Lydia to visit or
to provide his newly married daughter with money to purchase clothes. "
Chapters 5–8,"Chapters 5–8 Summary: Chapters 5–6 The Bennets’ neighbors are Sir William Lucas, his wife,
and their children. The eldest of these children, Charlotte, is
Elizabeth’s closest friend. The morning after the ball, the women
of the two families discuss the evening. They decide that while
Bingley danced with Charlotte first, he considered Jane to be the
prettiest of the local girls. The discussion then turns to Mr. Darcy,
and Elizabeth states that she will never dance with him; everyone
agrees that Darcy, despite his family and fortune, is too proud
to be likable. Bingley’s sisters exchange visits with the Bennets and
attempt to befriend Elizabeth and Jane. Meanwhile, Bingley continues
to pay attention to Jane, and Elizabeth decides that her sister
is “in a way to be very much in love” with him but is concealing
it very well. She discusses this with Charlotte Lucas, who comments
that if Jane conceals it too well, Bingley may lose interest. Elizabeth
says it is better for a young woman to be patient until she is sure
of her feelings; Charlotte disagrees, saying that it is best not
to know too much about the faults of one’s future husband. Darcy finds himself attracted to Elizabeth. He begins
listening to her conversations at parties, much to her surprise.
At one party at the Lucas house, Sir William attempts to persuade
Elizabeth and Darcy to dance together, but Elizabeth refuses. Shortly
afterward, Darcy tells Bingley’s unmarried sister that “Miss Elizabeth
Bennet” is now the object of his admiration. Summary: Chapters 7–8 The reader learns that Mr. Bennet’s property is entailed,
meaning that it must pass to a man after Mr. Bennet’s death and
cannot be inherited by any of his daughters. His two youngest children,
Catherine (nicknamed Kitty) and Lydia, entertain themselves by beginning
a series of visits to their mother’s sister, Mrs. Phillips, in the town
of Meryton, and gossiping about the militia stationed there. One night, while the Bennets are discussing the soldiers
over dinner, a note arrives inviting Jane to Netherfield Park for
a day. Mrs. Bennet conspires to send Jane by horse
rather than coach, knowing that it will rain and that Jane will
consequently have to spend the night at Mr. Bingley’s house. Unfortunately,
their plan works out too well: Jane is soaked, falls ill, and is
forced to remain at Netherfield as an invalid. Elizabeth goes to
visit her, hiking over on foot. When she arrives with soaked and
dirty stockings she causes quite a stir and is certain that the
Bingleys hold her in contempt for her soiled clothes. Jane insists
that her sister spend the night, and the Bingleys consent. That night, while Elizabeth visits Jane, the Bingley sisters
poke fun at the Bennets. Darcy and Mr. Bingley defend them, though Darcy
concedes, first, that he would not want his sister ever to go out
on such a walking expedition and, second, that the Bennets’ lack
of wealth and family make them poor marriage prospects. When Elizabeth
returns to the room, the discussion turns to Darcy’s library at
his ancestral home of Pemberley and then to Darcy’s opinions on
what constitutes an “accomplished woman.” After he and Bingley list
the attributes that such a woman would possess, Elizabeth declares
that she “never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and
elegance, as you describe, united,” implying that Darcy is far too
demanding. "
Chapters 9–12,"Chapters 9–12 Summary: Chapters 9–10 The next day, Mrs. Bennet arrives with Lydia and Catherine
to visit Jane. To Elizabeth’s dismay, Mrs. Bennet spends much of
her visit trying to convince Bingley to remain at Netherfield. During
her stay, Mrs. Bennet makes a general fool of herself, first by
comparing country life to the city and then by prattling on about
Jane’s beauty. Near the end of the visit, fifteen-year-old Lydia
asks Bingley whether he will hold a ball at Netherfield Park. He
replies that he must wait until Jane is fully recovered to hold
a ball. In the evening, Elizabeth observes Miss Bingley piling
compliments upon Darcy as he writes to his sister. The conversation
turns to Bingley’s style of letter writing and then to Bingley’s
impetuous behavior, which entangles Elizabeth and Darcy in an argument
over the virtues of accepting the advice of friends. Afterward,
Miss Bingley plays “a lively Scotch air” on the pianoforte, and
Elizabeth again refuses to dance with Darcy. Her refusal only increases
his admiration, and he considers that “were it not for the inferiority
of her connections, he should be in some danger.” Miss Bingley,
observing his attraction, becomes jealous and spends the following
day making fun of Elizabeth’s family, inviting Darcy to imagine
them connected to his proud and respectable line. That night, Miss Bingley begins reading in imitation of
Darcy—a further attempt to impress him. She chooses her book merely because
it is the second volume of the one that Darcy is reading. Of course,
being uninterested in literature, she is quickly bored and says
loudly, “I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How
much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book!—When I have a
house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent
library.” Summary: Chapters 11–12 Miss Bingley spends the following night in similar fashion,
trying to attract Darcy’s attention: first by reading, then by criticizing
the foolishness of balls, and finally by walking about the room.
Only when she asks Elizabeth to walk with her, however, does Darcy
look up, and then the two women discuss the possibility of finding
something to ridicule in his character. He states that his only
fault is resentment—“my good opinion once lost is lost forever.”
Elizabeth replies that it is hard to laugh at a “propensity to hate
every body,” and Miss Bingley, observing Elizabeth’s monopolization
of Darcy’s attention once again, insists on music. The next morning, Elizabeth writes to her mother to say
that she and Jane are ready to return home. Mrs. Bennet wishes Jane
to stay longer with Bingley, and she refuses to send the carriage.
Elizabeth, anxious to be away, insists on borrowing Bingley’s carriage
and she and her sister leave Netherfield Park. Darcy is glad to
see them go, as Elizabeth attracts him “more than he liked,” considering
her unsuitability as a prospect for matrimony. Analysis: Chapters 9–12 The continuation of Elizabeth’s visit to Netherfield accentuates
the respective attitudes of Miss Bingley and Darcy toward their
guest: jealousy on the part of the former, admiration on that of
the latter. Elizabeth poses a separate threat to each of them. Miss
Bingley fears her as a rival for Darcy’s affection, and Darcy fears
that he will succumb to his growing attraction to her despite the
impracticality of marriage to one of such inferior rank and family.
The anxiety created by class-consciousness thereby becomes a self-perpetuating,
warping institution. Darcy, concerned that he may affect his own
reputation by linking it to the poor reputation of another, tries to
avoid talking to Elizabeth entirely on the final day she spends
at Netherfield. He must tie himself up in a sort of logical knot;
class-consciousness transforms Elizabeth, who is perfect for him,
as something to be feared. Miss Bingley demonstrates how, once a class
system develops, it maintains its coherence. Miss Bingley feels threatened
by Elizabeth and knows she cannot compete with Elizabeth on the
basis of her virtues or talents. Her means of defense is to bring
class-anxiety to bear; by the luck of her birth, Miss Bingley has been
stamped as superior. She now uses the entire social institution of
class to maintain her superiority, even though all logic and experience
show that superiority to be a lie. "
Chapters 35–42,"Chapters 35–42 Summary: Chapters 35–36 The following day, Elizabeth takes a walk and runs into
Darcy, who gives her a letter. He walks away, and Elizabeth begins
to read it. In the letter, Darcy again admits to attempting to break
Bingley’s romance with Jane, but he defends himself by arguing that
Jane’s attachment to his friend was not yet strong enough to lead
to heartbreak. He adds that he did not wish Bingley to involve himself
with the social encumbrance of marrying into the Bennet family,
with its lack of both wealth and propriety. In relation to Wickham,
the letter states that Darcy did provide for him after his father’s
death and that the root of their quarrel lay in an attempt by Wickham
to elope with Darcy’s sister, Georgiana, in the hopes of obtaining
her fortune. Elizabeth is stunned by this revelation, and while she
dismisses some of what Darcy says about Jane and Bingley, his account
of Wickham’s doings causes her to reappraise the officer and decide that
she was probably wrong to trust him. Her feelings toward Darcy suddenly
enter into flux. Summary: Chapters 37–39 Darcy and Colonel Fitzwilliam leave Rosings. A week later,
Elizabeth departs the parsonage, despite Lady Catherine’s insistence
that she stay another two weeks. Before Elizabeth leaves, Mr. Collins informs
her that he and Charlotte seem to be made for one another (which
is clearly not true). He wishes Elizabeth the same happiness in
marriage that he himself enjoys. After a short stay at the Gardiners’s London house, Elizabeth, joined
by Jane, returns home. The two are met by Catherine and Lydia, who
talk of nothing but the soldiers as they ride home in their father’s
coach. The regiment is to be sent to Brighton for the summer, and
the two girls are hoping to convince their parents to summer there
also. In the course of the conversation, Lydia mentions, with some
satisfaction, that Wickham is no longer interested in Miss King,
who has gone to Liverpool to stay with her uncle. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet welcome their daughters home, and
the Lucases come for dinner. Lydia prattles about the exciting coach ride
and insists that the girls go to Meryton to see the officers. Not wanting
to see Wickham, Elizabeth refuses. Summary: Chapters 40–42 Elizabeth tells Jane the truth about Wickham. They debate
whether to expose him publicly, ultimately deciding against it.
Meanwhile, Mrs. Bennet continues to bemoan the loss of Mr. Bingley
as a husband for Jane and voices her displeasure at the happy marriage
of Charlotte and Mr. Collins. Lydia is invited to spend the summer
in Brighton by the wife of a Colonel Forster. Mr. Bennet allows
her to go, assuming that the colonel will keep her out of trouble. "
Chapters 18–23,"Chapters 18–23 Summary: Chapter 18 Much to Elizabeth’s dismay, Wickham does not attend the
ball. Mr. Denny tells Elizabeth and Lydia that Darcy’s presence
keeps Wickham away from Netherfield. Elizabeth’s unhappiness increases
during two clumsy dances with Mr. Collins and reaches its peak when she
finds herself dancing with Darcy. Their conversation is awkward,
especially when she mentions Wickham, a subject Darcy clearly wishes
to avoid. At the end of the dance, Elizabeth encounters Miss Bingley,
who warns her not to trust Wickham. Elizabeth assumes that Bingley’s
sister is only being spiteful, however, and chooses to ignore the
warning. Jane then tells her sister that she has asked Bingley for
information about Wickham. But everything Bingley knows about the
officer comes from Darcy and is therefore (in Elizabeth’s mind)
suspect. Mr. Collins, meanwhile, realizes that Darcy is related
to his patroness, Lady Catherine. In spite of Elizabeth’s best attempts
to dissuade him, he introduces himself. Darcy treats Mr. Collins
with contempt, but Mr. Collins is so obtuse that he does not notice. At supper, Mrs. Bennet discusses the hoped-for union of
Bingley and Jane so loudly that Elizabeth criticizes her, noting
that Darcy is listening. Mrs. Bennet, however, ignores Elizabeth
and continues rambling about the impending marriage. At the end
of the meal, Mary performs a terrible song for the company, and
Mr. Collins delivers a speech of epic and absurd pomposity. Elizabeth
feels that her family has completely embarrassed itself. Summary: Chapters 19–21 The next day, Mr. Collins proposes marriage to Elizabeth,
assuming that she will be overjoyed. She turns him down as gently
as possible, but he insists that she will change her mind shortly.
Mrs. Bennet, who regards a match between her daughter and Mr. Collins
as advantageous, is infuriated. She tells Elizabeth that if she
does not marry Mr. Collins she will never see her again, and she
asks Mr. Bennet to order Elizabeth to marry the clergyman. Her husband
refuses and, befitting his wit and his desire to annoy his wife,
actually informs his daughter that if she were to marry Mr. Collins,
he would refuse to see her again. A few days after the refused proposal, Elizabeth encounters Wickham
in Meryton. He apologizes for his absence from the ball and walks
her home, where Elizabeth introduces him to her parents. That same
day, a letter arrives for Jane from Miss Bingley, informing her
that Bingley and his party are returning to the city indefinitely and
implying that Bingley plans to marry Darcy’s sister, Georgiana. Elizabeth
comforts Jane, telling her that this turn of events is all Miss
Bingley’s doing, not her brother’s, and that Bingley will return to
Netherfield. Summary: Chapters 22–23 Suddenly, news arrives that Mr. Collins has
proposed to Charlotte Lucas and that Elizabeth’s friend has accepted.
Elizabeth is shocked, despite Charlotte’s insistence that the match
is the best for which she could hope. Mrs. Bennet, of course, is
furious with her daughter for allowing a husband to escape her,
and as the days go by with no word from Bingley, Jane’s marriage
prospects, too, begin to appear limited. "
Chapters 24–26,"Chapters 24–26 Summary: Chapters 24–25 Miss Bingley sends another letter, this one praising the
beauty and charm of Darcy’s sister. The letter further states that
Bingley will remain in London all winter, putting an end to the
Bennets’s hopes that he might return to Netherfield. Elizabeth is
very upset by this news and complains to Jane that people lack “merit
or sense,” referring to Bingley for apparently abandoning Jane,
and to Charlotte Lucas for agreeing to marry Mr. Collins. Meanwhile,
Mrs. Bennet’s hopes of seeing her daughters wed fade rapidly. Mr.
Bennet seems amused: he encourages Elizabeth’s interest in Wickham,
so that she, like her sister, can be “crossed in love.” Mrs. Bennet’s brother, Mr. Gardiner, comes to stay with
the family. Immediately recognizing Jane’s sadness, the Gardiners
invite Jane to accompany them back to London when they finish their visit,
hoping that a change in scenery might raise Jane’s spirits. Jane accepts,
excited also that in London she might get an opportunity to see
Mr. Bingley. In the course of evenings spent with various friends and
the military officers, Mrs. Gardiner notices that Elizabeth and Wickham,
though not in any serious sort of love, show a definite preference
for each other. Because of his lack of money, Mrs. Gardiner does
not think of Wickham as a good match for Elizabeth, though she is
fond of Wickham’s stories of his life around Darcy’s estate at Pemberley,
which is near where Mrs. Gardiner grew up. Summary: Chapter 26 At the first opportunity, Mrs. Gardiner warns Elizabeth
that Wickham’s lack of money makes him an unsuitable match. She
further says that Elizabeth should be careful not to embarrass her
father by becoming attached to Wickham. Elizabeth responds carefully,
stating that she will try to keep Wickham from falling in love with
her and that she devoutly wishes not to upset her father, but concluding that
all she can do is her best. After Jane and the Gardiners depart for London, Mr. Collins returns
from a visit to his parish for his wedding. Elizabeth reluctantly
promises to visit Charlotte after her marriage. Meanwhile, Jane’s
letters from London recount how she called on Miss Bingley and how
Miss Bingley was cold to her and visited her only briefly in return.
Jane believes that Bingley’s sister views her as an obstacle to her
brother’s marrying Georgiana Darcy. Mrs. Gardiner writes to Elizabeth to ask about Wickham,
and Elizabeth replies that his attentions have shifted to another
girl, a Miss King, who has just inherited a large fortune. This
turn of events touches Elizabeth’s heart “but slightly . . . and
her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been
his only choice, had fortune permitted it.” The narrator then goes
on to point out that Elizabeth’s equanimity about Wickham trying
to marry for money is somewhat out of joint with her disgust that
Charlotte would do the same thing. As for Elizabeth, the very limited
pain that Wickham’s transfer of affections causes her makes her
believe she was never in love with him. Analysis: Chapters 24–26 The first three chapters of Book Two introduce the Gardiners,
who prove to be Elizabeth’s most sensible relatives. They often
seem to act as surrogate parents to Jane and Elizabeth. The nurturing
and supportive Gardiners take Jane to London to distract her from
her unhappiness over Bingley. However amusing the reader finds him, Mr.
Bennet, in contrast, seems to have no real understanding of when
his children even need help. He prefers withdrawing into the peace
of his library to coping with the problems facing his family. In particular,
Mr. Bennet’s amusement at his wife’s distress and his suggestion
that Elizabeth develop a crush on Wickham emphasize the extent to
which he has abandoned the paternal role in the family. His wit
and intelligence make him a sympathetic character in many ways,
but he seems to absent himself from important matters. Later in
the novel, his negligence allows Lydia to go to Brighton for the summer
and then to elope with Wickham. At this point in the novel, Austen
compels her reader to contrast Mr. Bennet’s unhelpful suggestion
about Wickham with Mrs. Gardiner’s recognition that the officer
is not a suitable match for her niece. "
Chapters 27–34,"Chapters 27–34 Summary: Chapters 27–29 In March, Elizabeth travels with Sir William
Lucas to visit Charlotte and her new husband, Mr. Collins. On the
way, they spend a night in London with Jane and the Gardiners. Elizabeth
and Mrs. Gardiner speak about Wickham’s attempts to win over Miss King.
Mrs. Gardiner is critical of him, calling him a “mercenary,” but
Elizabeth defends him, calling him prudent. Before Elizabeth leaves
London, the Gardiners invite her to accompany them on a tour, perhaps out to the lakes. Elizabeth
gleefully accepts. When Elizabeth arrives in Hunsford, the location
of Mr. Collins’s parish, the clergyman greets her enthusiastically,
as does Charlotte. On the second day of her visit, she sees Miss
de Bourgh, Lady de Bourgh’s daughter, from a window. The girl is “sickly
and cross,” Elizabeth decides, and she imagines with some satisfaction
Darcy’s marrying such an unappealing person. Miss de Bourgh invites
them to dine at Rosings, a mansion that awes even Sir William Lucas
with its grandeur. At dinner, Lady Catherine dominates the conversation.
After the meal, she grills Elizabeth concerning her upbringing,
deciding that the Bennet sisters have been badly reared. The failure
of Mrs. Bennet to hire a governess, the girls’ lack of musical and artistic
talents, and Elizabeth’s own impudence are all mentioned before
the end of the evening. Summary: Chapters 30–32 Sir William departs after a week, satisfied with his daughter’s
contentment. Shortly thereafter, Darcy and a cousin named Colonel Fitzwilliam
visit their aunt at Rosings. When Mr. Collins pays his respects,
the two men accompany him back to his parsonage and visit briefly
with Elizabeth and Charlotte. Another invitation to Rosings follows, and Colonel Fitzwilliam pays
special attention to Elizabeth during the dinner. After the meal, she
plays the pianoforte and pokes fun at Darcy, informing Colonel Fitzwilliam
of his bad behavior at the Meryton ball, at which he refused to
dance with her. Lady Catherine lectures Elizabeth on the proper
manner of playing the instrument, forcing Elizabeth to remain at
the keyboard until the end of the evening. The next day, Darcy visits the parsonage and tells Elizabeth
that Bingley is unlikely to spend much of his time at Netherfield
Park in the future. The rest of their conversation is awkward, and
when Darcy departs, Charlotte declares that he must be in love with
Elizabeth, or he would never have called in such an odd manner.
In the days that follow, both Darcy and his cousin visit frequently,
however, and eventually Charlotte surmises that it is perhaps Colonel Fitzwilliam
who is interested in Elizabeth. "
Chapters 50–55,"Chapters 50–55 Summary: Chapters 50–51 Elizabeth realizes that her opinion of Darcy has changed
so completely that if he were to propose to her again, she would
accept. She understands, however, that, given Lydia’s embarrassing
behavior and the addition of Wickham to the Bennet family, such
a proposal seems extremely unlikely. Mr. Gardiner writes to Mr. Bennet again to inform him
that Wickham has accepted a commission in the North of England. Lydia
asks to be allowed to visit her family before she goes north with
her new husband. After much disagreement, the Bennets allow the
newlyweds to stay at their home. The ten-day visit is difficult: Lydia
is oblivious to all of the trouble that she has caused, and Wickham
behaves as if he has done nothing wrong. One morning while sitting
with Jane and Elizabeth, Lydia describes her wedding and mentions
that Darcy was in the church. Elizabeth is amazed and sends a letter
to Mrs. Gardiner asking for details. Summary: Chapters 52–53 Mrs. Gardiner replies to Elizabeth that it was Darcy who
found Lydia and Wickham, and Darcy who paid Wickham the money that facilitated
the marriage. She drops hints that Darcy did so because of his love
for Elizabeth. Elizabeth’s surprise is immense, and she is unsure
whether to be upset or pleased. After Wickham and Lydia depart for their new home in the North,
news arrives that Bingley is returning to Netherfield Park for a
few weeks. Mr. Bennet refuses to visit him, much to the family’s discomfort.
Three days after his arrival at Netherfield, however, Bingley comes
to the Bennets’s home, accompanied by Darcy. Mrs. Bennet is overly
attentive to Bingley and quite rude to Darcy, completely unaware
that he was the one who saved Lydia. Before departing, the gentlemen
promise to dine at Longbourn soon. Summary: Chapters 54–55 Darcy and Bingley come to dinner; Bingley places himself
next to Jane and pays her much attention while Darcy finds a seat
at the opposite end of the table from Elizabeth, rendering conversation between
the two impossible. Elizabeth accepts that having been refused by
her once, Darcy will not ask her to marry him again.  Bingley visits the Bennets a few days later, and Mrs.
Bennet invites him to dinner. He tells her that he is already engaged
for the day but eagerly accepts an invitation for the following
day. He calls so early in the morning that he arrives before the
women have gotten dressed. After the meal, Mrs. Bennet manages (clumsily)
to leave Bingley alone with Jane but he does not propose. The following
day, however, Bingley goes shooting with Mr. Bennet and stays for
dinner. After the meal, he finds himself alone with Jane again.
This time, he tells her that he will ask Mr. Bennet for permission
to marry her. Mr. Bennet happily agrees and Jane tells Elizabeth
that she is “the happiest creature in the world.” "
Chapters 56–61,"Chapters 56–61 Summary: Chapter 56 A week after Bingley and Jane become engaged, Lady Catherine
de Bourgh visits the Bennets. The noblewoman wants to speak with Elizabeth
and insists that they walk outside to hold a conversation. There,
Lady Catherine informs Elizabeth that she has heard a rumor that
Darcy is planning to marry her. Such a notion, Lady Catherine insists,
is ridiculous, given Elizabeth’s low station in life and the tacit engagement
of Darcy to her own daughter. Elizabeth conceals her surprise at this news and acts
very coolly toward Lady Catherine. She admits that she and Darcy
are not engaged but, despite the noblewoman’s demands, refuses to
promise not to enter into an engagement to him. Lady Catherine claims that
Elizabeth is bound to obey her by “the claims of duty, honour, and
gratitude.” She presents the familiar objection: the Bennets have
such low connections that Darcy’s marrying Elizabeth would “ruin
him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt
of the world.” Elizabeth defends her family, declaring, “I am a
gentleman’s daughter,” and then asserts her independence from the
exasperating control that such snobs as Mr. Collins, Miss Bingley,
and Lady Catherine herself always attempt to exert over their social
inferiors. “I am . . . resolved,” she says, “to act in that manner, which
will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference
to you, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.” Lady Catherine
leaves, furious and frustrated, and Elizabeth keeps their conversation
secret. Summary: Chapters 57–58 
 A short time later, a letter arrives from Mr. Collins
that suggests that an engagement between Darcy and Elizabeth is
imminent. The letter comes to Mr. Bennet, who reads it to Elizabeth
and comments on the absurdity of the idea of an engagement with
Darcy—“who never looked at any woman but to see a blemish, and who
probably never looked at you in his life.” A little while after Lady Catherine’s visit, Darcy again
comes to stay with Bingley at Netherfield. The two friends visit
the Bennets, and everyone takes a walk together. Elizabeth and Darcy
lag behind, and when they are alone, Elizabeth thanks him for his
generosity in saving Lydia’s good name. Darcy replies that he did
so only because Lydia is her sister. He then says that his feelings
toward her have not changed since his proposal. Elizabeth tells
him that her own feelings have changed and that she is now willing
to marry him. Summary: Chapters 59–60 That night, Elizabeth tells Jane about Darcy’s intention
to marry her. Jane, stunned, cannot believe that Elizabeth truly
loves Darcy. Elizabeth promises Jane that she does. The next day,
Darcy and Elizabeth walk together again, and that night Darcy goes
to Mr. Bennet to ask him for his consent to the match. Like Jane, Mr. Bennet needs Elizabeth to convince him
that she does indeed care for Darcy. After she assures him of her
love, she tells him how Darcy paid off Wickham. Mrs. Bennet then
learns of her daughter’s engagement and is actually struck dumb
for a time before bursting into cries of delight. "

Chapters 1–3 ,"Summary: Chapter 1  
 	The narrator opens the novel by introducing us to Emma
Woodhouse, a girl endowed with “some of the best blessings of existence,”
including good looks, intelligence, riches, and an affectionate father.
Emma’s only disadvantages are that she is slightly spoiled and that
she thinks “a little too well of herself.” Emma’s mother died before
Emma could form many memories of her, but her gentle governess,
Miss Taylor, provided a motherly love. After Emma’s older sister,
Isabella, was married and moved to London, Miss Taylor and Emma
became best friends. 	As the novel begins, Miss Taylor has just left Hartfield,
the estate of Emma and Mr. Woodhouse, to marry a widower named Mr. Weston,
and Emma is left without a companion. She attempts to comfort her
despondent father, who hates change, with the thought that they
will see the new Mrs. Weston often, but Emma only partially succeeds
in comforting herself. At this moment, neighborhood resident Mr.
Knightley, the brother of Isabella’s husband, pays a visit, having
returned from visiting their mutual relations in London. He affirms
the appropriateness of the match between Mr. Weston and Miss Taylor
and gently chides Emma when she claims credit. Emma declares that
she will repeat her matchmaking success by finding a wife for Mr.
Elton, the village rector. Summary: Chapter 2  The narrator recounts Mr. Weston’s history. His first
marriage was to a woman named Miss Churchill, who came from a higher
class than his. They had a son, named Frank, but the marriage was
overshadowed by the disapproval of Mrs. Weston’s brother and sister-in-law,
Mr. and Mrs. Churchill. When Mrs. Weston died after three years
of marriage, Frank was essentially adopted by Mr. and Mrs. Churchill
and made their heir. Mr. Weston, left impoverished by the expectations
of his first wife, spent the next twenty years of his life rebuilding
his fortune. He eventually purchased Randalls, the small estate
where he lives with the second Mrs. Weston. 	The village has always been curious to see Frank Churchill,
who writes a kind letter to Mrs. Weston indicating that he will
pay a visit to his father and stepmother. Summary: Chapter 3  The Woodhouses give a small dinner party, to which they
invite other members of their social circle: the widow Mrs. Bates;
her single, middle-aged daughter, Miss Bates; and Mrs. Goddard,
the mistress of the local boarding school. Mrs. Goddard brings one
of her boarders, Harriet Smith, a girl whose parentage is unknown.
Emma admires Harriet for her beauty and for her respect of Emma
and Hartfield. She resolves to pursue friendship with Harriet, and
to improve the naïve girl by detaching her from the inferior acquaintance
of the farming Martin family. She plans to introduce Harriet to
higher society. Analysis: Chapters 1–3 The narration of these opening chapters creates a complicated
portrait of Emma as a young, beautiful, clever, and confident character who
exercises her influence in a constricted and complex environment
and has much to learn about friendship, love, and the ways of the
world. Emma’s affection for Miss Taylor and her kindness to her foolish
and somewhat tiresome father reveal Emma’s capacity for true warmth
and generosity. But, at the same time, the narrator quickly alerts
us to the ways in which Emma is spoiled by her advantages and blinded
by her own self-regard. Most explicitly, we are told at the novel’s
beginning: "
Chapters 25–27 ,"Summary: Chapter 25  Emma’s good opinion of Frank Churchill is injured when
he makes a day trip to London just to have his hair cut. Though
Emma does not feel inclined to give up her vow to remain single,
she decides that Frank is pleasing enough that she does not mind
being associated with him in other people’s minds. Mr. Knightley
thinks Frank is a silly young man, just as he had suspected. 	Meanwhile, an invitation from the Coles, successful tradespeople
who live in Highbury, creates a conundrum for Emma. She had originally
decided that she would not accept an invitation from the nouveau-riche
family, but when everyone except the Woodhouses receives an invitation
to a dinner party at the Coles’ home, Emma feels left out. When
an invitation arrives, she decides to accept it. Summary: Chapter 26  Emma arrives at the Coles’ party behind Mr. Knightley.
Because Knightley usually walks, Emma is surprised that he has come
in his carriage. At dinner, it is revealed that Jane Fairfax has
received the mysterious gift of a pianoforte. People assume the
piano is from Colonel Campbell, but Emma tells Frank she suspects
that it is a gift from Mr. Dixon. When Jane arrives later, she blushes
when questioned about the piano. 	Meanwhile, Mrs. Weston tells Emma that Mr. Knightley
brought his carriage so that he could convey Jane home. Mrs. Weston
suggests that a match may be forming between Jane and Mr. Knightley, but
Emma resists this supposition vigorously, explaining that she cannot
bear the thought of Mr. Knightley marrying because then her nephew,
George and Isabella’s son Henry, will not be able to inherit Donwell
Abbey, the Knightley estate in the town of the same name. Mrs. Weston
suspects that Mr. Knightley is the one who sent Jane the pianoforte. 	Emma and Jane sing and play the piano for the company,
with Frank accompanying. When Frank persuades Jane to sing one more song
after her voice has begun to grow hoarse, Mr. Knightley intervenes.
Emma questions Mr. Knightley about the carriage and pianoforte.
His answers convince her that he did not send the gift, but do not
enable her to decide if he has feelings for Jane. When impromptu dancing
begins, she is relieved that he does not ask Jane to dance. Emma
is also pleased that Frank immediately asks her and not Jane for
a dance. There is time for only two dances, however, before the party
breaks up. Frank comments to Emma that he is lucky the dancing had
to end; otherwise he would have found himself asking Jane Fairfax
for a dance. Summary: Chapter 27  Emma is thoroughly pleased with her evening at the Coles,
but she is uncertain about the appropriateness of telling Frank
about her suspicions about Jane or acknowledging the superiority
of Jane’s musical abilities. At the Coles’ party, Harriet heard
that Mr. Martin had dined with the Cox family, and there is a rumor
that a Cox daughter would like to marry Mr. Martin. To distract
and protect Harriet, Emma accompanies her on a shopping trip. They
then decide to pay a visit to the Bates household and run into Frank
and Mrs. Weston on their way. The visit seems to have been Frank’s
idea, but he offers to stay with Emma and send Mrs. Weston to make
the visit on her own. Emma sends him along, knowing that he will
later come see her at Hartfield, but Miss Bates then comes into
the shop to ask Emma to come give her opinion of Jane’s new pianoforte.
In her rambling, Miss Bates reveals that Mr. Knightley has sent
his last apples of the season to Jane, who is particularly fond
of them. "
Chapters 4–6 ,"Summary: Chapter 4  Emma and Harriet strike up an immediate intimacy as Harriet replaces
Mrs. Weston as Emma’s companion on her habitual walks. Emma remains
unimpressed with Harriet’s intelligence but appreciates her willingness
to be guided. Emma encourages Harriet to tell everything about herself,
and their conversation soon centers on the Martin family, which
Harriet has visited frequently over the past two months. Emma is
alarmed to learn that the family includes an eligible bachelor,
Mr. Robert Martin, and fears that her friend may have feelings for
him. A match between Harriet and Mr. Martin would be unacceptable
to Emma because the Martins are farmers, and therefore, in her opinion,
socially beneath her new friend. She discourages Harriet from thinking
well of Mr. Martin by asking questions about his education and predicting
that any wife Mr. Martin takes will be too inferior to merit friendship
with Harriet. After they run into Mr. Martin on one of their walks,
Emma encourages Harriet to compare his manners with those of the
gentlemen they know, praising Mr. Elton’s manners as particularly
genteel. The narrator reveals that Emma determined during the party
at Hartfield to encourage a match between Harriet and Mr. Elton. Summary: Chapter 5  Mr. Knightley and Mrs. Weston converse about Emma’s new
friendship with Harriet. Knightley believes that the friendship
is dangerous for both parties. Harriet’s flattery, Knightley suspects,
will reinforce Emma’s self-regard, while Emma’s influence will injure Harriet’s
happiness, because Harriet “will grow just refined enough to be
uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstance have
placed her home.” Mrs. Weston disagrees, believing that Emma needs
Harriet’s companionship and that Emma’s company will improve Harriet.
She advises Knightley to keep his mouth shut, and the conversation
ends with speculation about what will become of Emma. Noting Emma’s
declaration that she will never marry and her lack of suitable prospects,
Knightley comments that he “should like to see Emma in love, and
in some doubt of a return; it would do her good.” Summary: Chapter 6  Emma continues to point out Mr. Elton’s finer qualities
to Harriet and is convinced that he is already in love with her
friend. Mr. Elton praises the graces that Harriet has gained in
Emma’s company, and he quickly seconds Emma’s idea to paint a watercolor
portrait of Harriet. As Emma paints, Mr. Elton is only too attentive
to her progress, and though Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley point
out that Emma has exaggerated Harriet’s beauty, Mr. Elton emphatically praises
the portrait’s likeness. He volunteers to take the watercolor to
London to be framed. All the while, Emma continues to believe that
Mr. Elton’s enthusiasm is for Harriet, though Mr. Elton makes comments
on Emma’s skill in rendering and improving on the beautiful subject. Analysis: Chapters 4–6 Over the course of these three chapters, we learn that
Emma is extremely class-conscious and also somewhat manipulative.
She unattractively dismisses Robert Martin because of his social
class, saying, “The yeomanry [the class of farmers who hold land
under long- term leases] are precisely the order of people with
whom I feel I can have nothing to do. A degree or two lower, and
a creditable appearance might interest me; I might hope to be useful
to their families in some way or another.” In other words, Emma
is only interested in people who are of her social class or so far
beneath her that she might, from a comfortable position of superiority,
flatter herself by being “useful” to them. Such superior usefulness
is what Emma attempts with Harriet, and she even lies to her friend
in order to manipulate her. Although Emma observes to herself that
Mr. Martin’s “appearance was very neat and he looked like a sensible
young man,” she tells Harriet, “He is very plain … remarkably plain,
but that is nothing compared to his entire want of gentility.” 	Mr. Knightley and Mrs. Weston make Emma seem more likable than
she makes herself seem. Because Knightley shows himself to have
good sense, and also because he is the one character willing to find
fault with Emma, he is the novel’s most reliable mouthpiece for Austen’s
views of Emma. His discussion of Emma shows that he genuinely cares
for her but views her as a child lacking sense and understanding
rather than as an equal. He believes that Emma has been “spoiled
by being the cleverest of her family” but respects her stubbornness
and independence. He also admits that though Emma is very pretty,
she is not vain about her looks; “her vanity lies another way.”
Knightley’s pointed criticisms are offset by Mrs. Weston’s dismissive
remarks that Emma is a caring daughter, sister, and friend who “will
make no lasting blunder.” 	Like Austen’s narration, the dialogue between characters
frequently contains a subtext available only to certain characters
or to the reader. For instance, when Emma says to Harriet, “I wish
you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, when ever [Mr. Martin] does marry—I
mean as to being acquainted with his wife … it does not follow that
he might marry anybody at all fit for you to notice,” we admire
the cleverness of Emma’s suggestion to Harriet that Mr. Martin is
beneath her, even as we disapprove of Emma’s action. Chapter  "
Chapters 7–9 ,"Summary: Chapter 7  Harriet receives a letter from Mr. Martin proposing marriage
and goes directly to Emma to seek advice. Emma acts as if there
is obviously no doubt that Harriet should not accept, and she proceeds
to offer Harriet advice about the wording of her refusal. When it becomes
clear that Harriet is doubtful about her answer, Emma becomes somewhat
cold and disingenuously states, “I shall not give you any advice,
Harriet. . . . This is a point which you must settle with your own
feelings.” When, under Emma’s subtle guidance, Harriet states that
she will probably reject Mr. Martin, Emma immediately congratulates
her friend on having made the right decision and points out that
if Harriet had accepted him, then Emma would no longer be able to
be her friend. Harriet immediately affirms that the loss of Emma
is unthinkable, and the two of them draft a letter refusing the
proposal. It is clear that Harriet is pained by her decision and
cares for Mr. Martin, but Emma cheers her up with reminders of Mr.
Elton. Summary: Chapter 8  With Harriet at Mrs. Goddard’s preparing for an extended
visit to Hartfield, Mr. Knightley and Emma have the opportunity
for a lengthy conversation about Harriet and Mr. Martin. Knightley reveals
that Mr. Martin has consulted him about proposing to Harriet, and
Mr. Knightley makes it clear that he supports the match. Emma informs
him that the proposal has already been made and rejected, and she
insists that Mr. Martin is not Harriet’s equal. Knightley very nearly
loses his temper, and he insists upon Mr. Martin’s superiority to
Harriet in sense and “true gentility.” Knightley is especially displeased
by what he immediately guesses was Emma’s role in the rejection,
and he states flatly, “You have been no friend to Harriet Smith.”
Emma counters that Harriet’s beauty and good temper, along with
the possibility that she is the daughter of a gentleman, make her
a desirable match. Knightley tells Emma that if she thinks Mr. Elton
will marry Harriet, she is wrong, because Elton will only marry
a woman with money. Vexed with one another, Emma and Knightley part
ways. Emma is comforted by the return of Harriet, who has heard
a rumor that Elton is on an important errand regarding a lady. Summary: Chapter 9  Emma and Harriet have been collecting riddles (also called
“charades”) into a scrapbook, and when Mr. Elton returns from London with
the framed portrait of Harriet, he contributes one. Emma immediately
decodes the riddle and sees that its answer is the word “courtship.”
She translates the riddle for Harriet, who could not solve it herself,
but Harriet is nonetheless flattered by its meaning. Emma convinces
Harriet that the riddle foretells a proposal, and she copies the
riddle into Harriet’s book. After some discussion among the family
anticipating the upcoming Christmas visit of Isabella, Mr. John
Knightley, and their children, Emma tells Mr. Elton that she has
solved his charade and copied it into Harriet’s book. Elton is clearly
moved, and Emma concludes that his emotion comes from seeing his
riddle in Harriet’s book. Analysis: Chapters 7–9 Chapters  Emma’s conversation with Mr. Knightley, in Chapter  	Sharing riddles was a common genteel pastime in the early
nineteenth century, and the riddle in Chapter  "
Chapters 28–30 ,"Summary: Chapter 28  Emma enters the Bates’ sitting room and finds Frank occupied
with fixing Mrs. Bates’s glasses and Jane seated at the piano. Frank
asks Jane questions about how she imagines the piano came to her,
and his comment, “True affection only could have prompted it,” makes Jane
blush. Believing that Frank is teasing Jane unkindly about Mr. Dixon,
Emma whispers that he should stop, and she regrets having shared
her speculations about Jane with him. Mr. Knightley stops by to
check on Jane’s health but refuses to come in when he hears that Frank
is there. Summary: Chapter 29  While the Woodhouses are visiting Randalls, Frank and
Emma work on planning a ball so they can finish the dancing inaugurated at
the Coles’. They decide the room at Randalls is too small. Mr. Woodhouse
privately tells Mrs. Weston his concern that Frank is so thoughtless
about opening and shutting doors that he exposes Emma, Harriet,
and Mrs. Weston to dangerous drafts. The next solution proposed
by Frank on behalf of Mr. Weston is that the ball be given at the
Crown Inn. Though Frank does a poor job reassuring Mr. Woodhouse
that this plan will not give them all colds, Emma comforts her father,
and she agrees to the plan. There are further practical difficulties,
and Frank proposes he go fetch Miss Bates along with her niece,
whom Frank admits he does not immediately recollect, for advice.
By the time he returns, the difficulties have been resolved, the
date of the ball has been set, and Frank secures from Emma a promise
to dance the first two dances with him. Summary: Chapter 30  Emma is worried that Frank’s aunt, Mrs. Churchill, will
refuse Frank permission to stay on for the ball, which is scheduled
for a few days after his visit is scheduled to end. To everyone’s
relief, he receives this permission. Only Mr. Knightley refuses
to look forward to the ball: he does not seem interested in dancing.
Emma takes Knightley’s diffidence as further proof that he is not
interested in Jane, who in a rare moment of openness confesses how
much she looks forward to the ball. 	Two days later, Frank is called back to Enscombe because
his aunt is ill. The ball is postponed indefinitely, and Frank comes
to Emma to say goodbye. He is clearly dejected and speaks haltingly—for
a moment, it seems as if he is going to declare something serious. Interrupted
by his father, Frank departs, and Emma is depressed. Highbury society
is, it seems for Emma, severely diminished without Frank’s charms.
Emma concludes that she must be “a little in love” with Frank after
all. Analysis: Chapters 28–30 During Emma and Frank’s visit to the Bates’, Emma, Frank,
and Jane are all aware that the dialogue taking place has a subtext,
but Austen crafts Frank’s words so that the subtexts Emma and Jane read
differ from one another. At this point in the novel, our misperceptions
are likely to closely match Emma’s, and we follow her in believing
that Frank’s teasing of Jane about the origins of her piano cruelly
refers to Mr. Dixon. Though Emma gossips maliciously about Jane, her selfless
protectiveness of Jane when she believes Frank to be teasing her
shows that Emma’s willingness to amuse herself at the expense of
another has limits. When we later learn that the piano is actually
a gift from Frank, Jane’s secret fiancé, we realize that his teasing
is more good-natured, emphasizing his own gesture of affection. "
Chapters 19–21 ,"Summary: Chapter 19  During a walk, Emma has little success turning Harriet’s
thoughts from Mr. Elton and therefore decides that they should call
on Mrs. and Miss Bates, a duty that Emma usually shuns. During their
visit, they are forced to hear about Mr. Elton and his travels,
and though Emma has tried to time her visit so as to avoid hearing
about Miss Bates’s niece, Jane Fairfax, Miss Bates produces a letter
from Jane, who lives with her guardians, Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.
The Campbells are about to visit their newly married daughter, Mrs. Dixon,
in Ireland, which means that Jane will be coming for an extended
visit in Highbury in a week’s time. Based on slight evidence, Emma
suspects that there has been a romance between Jane and the Campbells’
daughter’s husband, Mr. Dixon, and that this is the reason that
Jane is missing the trip to Ireland. Summary: Chapter 20  Jane’s history is given, starting from how, at age three,
she became an orphan after her father was killed in battle and her
mother died of consumption and grief. Jane lived with her aunt and
grandmother in Highbury until she was eight years old. Then, a friend
of her father’s, Colonel Campbell, took an interest in her well-being
and made her part of his household. He provided her with an education, but,
since he would be unable to give her an inheritance, it was understood
that when Jane came of age she would become a governess. Meanwhile,
Jane became dear to the Campbell family and enjoyed the pleasures
of elegant society in London. Her stay in Highbury constitutes her
last taste of freedom before becoming a governess. 	Jane arrives, and Emma greets the girl’s return after
two years’ absence with mixed feelings. She has never liked Jane,
for reasons she cannot fully explain (Mr. Knightley suggests to
her that she is jealous), but Jane’s beauty impresses her, and she
feels compassion for her impending fate. Soon the dullness of Jane’s
companions, along with Jane’s reserve, confirms Emma’s dislike.
Emma discovers that Jane has known Frank Churchill in Weymouth,
but Jane divulges little information about him. Summary: Chapter 21  Just as Mr. Knightley is about to give Emma some news,
the Bateses arrive with Jane to thank the Woodhouses for the hindquarter
of pork they have sent; they manage to precede Knightley in divulging that
Mr. Elton is to marry a Miss Hawkins. Emma is caught off guard,
and Mr. Knightley’s looks suggest he knows something of what has
transpired between them. However, she soon regains enough composure
to make another failed attempt to engage Jane in conversation. The
company departs, and Harriet bursts in with news that she has run
into Mr. Martin and his sister in town. She relates that after some
awkwardness, the pair greeted her with kindness, leaving Harriet
flustered. Emma is impressed by the Martins’ behavior and briefly
second-guesses her judgment of them, but she concludes that their
station in life is still too low for Harriet. She is only able to
distract Harriet from the episode by sharing the news of Mr. Elton’s
impending marriage. Analysis: Chapters 19–21 Miss Bates’s repetitious speeches, and the mileage she
can get from a single letter or piece of news from someone outside
of Highbury, strongly reinforce our sense of the claustrophobia
of village life. Though the character of Miss Bates is considered
a comic masterpiece, there is also a pathetic and even alarming
quality to the narrowness of her experience. In contrast to more
sophisticated and calculating characters such as Emma and Mr. Knightley,
who conceal or reveal what they are thinking depending upon the
appropriateness of the situation and the effect they wish to produce,
Miss Bates narrates everything that passes through her head, all
of it more or less harmless. 	With a more developed sense of Miss Bates’s character,
Austen provides some distinctly different views of women’s experience
in Highbury. She makes an implicit statement about intelligence
and its potential for creating hardship when she contrasts Emma
and Miss Bates. For instance, Miss Bates speaks in absurdly long,
digressive sentences, interrupting herself frequently and often
forgetting her point. In one example, she says: "
Chapters 16–18 ,"Summary: Chapter 16  
 	Back at Hartfield after her ride with Mr. Elton, Emma
plunges into self-recrimination as she looks back over the past
weeks. Her biggest regret concerns Harriet, whose feelings for Elton,
Emma realizes, are due mostly to Emma’s own encouragement. She decides
she need not pity Elton, because the artificiality of his addresses
suggests that he was more interested in her fortune than in herself.
She realizes that both of the Knightley brothers have been right
about Elton and that she has been wrong all along. Emma vows to
give up matchmaking, but she cannot stop herself from searching
for a new suitor for Harriet. 	The next morning, Emma is comforted by the reflection
that neither Elton’s nor Harriet’s feelings could have been very
strong and by the fact that no one else needs to know what has happened.
Several days of snow provide a respite, as everyone stays at home,
but Emma dreads telling Harriet what has happened. Summary: Chapter 17  Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley return to London, and Mr.
Elton writes Mr. Woodhouse to announce that he will spend the next
few weeks in the town of Bath. Relieved, Emma immediately visits
Harriet to explain what has happened. Emma’s sense of her own failures,
and Harriet’s modesty and sweetness in taking the news, give Emma
the temporary impression that Harriet, rather than herself, is “the
superior creature.” She moves Harriet to Hartfield and attempts
to comfort her and drive Elton out of Harriet’s mind. Emma tries
to prepare Harriet for the inevitable moment when they will see
Elton in their social circle after he returns from Bath. Summary: Chapter 18  Frank Churchill does not make his expected visit, to the
disappointment of Mrs. Weston in particular. Emma, preoccupied with
her other worries, does not mind, but she feels she must express
disappointment so that she will appear her usual self. Her warmth
in doing so gets her into an argument with Mr. Knightley about the young
man. Knightley expresses the same thought Emma has expressed: how
can a twenty-four-year-old man be prevented by his aunt from doing
his duty? In reply, Emma suggests that Knightley is a poor judge
of “the difficulties of dependence.” She expresses her sympathies
for Frank’s situation and her conviction that he would come if he
could, but Knightley counters that no sensible, honorable man would
be prevented from doing his duty. Emma predicts that Frank, when
he does arrive in Highbury, will be perfectly charming. Knightley
believes that Frank will be superficial and insufferable, and Knightley’s
prejudice against the stranger surprises Emma. Analysis: Chapters 16–18 Chapter  	However, Emma has not totally shed her former shortcomings. Emma’s
resolution to cease matchmaking is put in terms that suggest she
has gained a good deal of insight: “It was foolish, it was wrong,
to take so active a part in bringing two people together. It was
adventuring too far, assuming too much, making light of what ought
to be serious—a trick of what ought to be simple.” But soon she
is imagining new matches for Harriet, though she stops herself with
the recognition of her own relapse. Emma’s reflection that “there
had been no real affection either in [Elton’s] language or manners”
shows her continued sense of the superiority of her mind and manners
to Elton’s. She blames Elton probably more than he deserves for
her own mistakes, and her quick assumption that his feelings for
her were insincere seems self-serving. Her revised understanding
of Elton is accurate, but her refusal to implicate herself as party
to his misunderstanding shows that Emma’s self-understanding is
not complete. "
Chapters 22–24 ,"Summary: Chapter 22  In Highbury, there is great speculation about Miss Hawkins,
Mr. Elton’s fiancée. Mr. Elton returns to the village long enough
to confirm the rumors that his bride-to-be is beautiful, accomplished,
and of some fortune. Emma is relieved that his marriage will ease
the awkwardness of his return to their social circle, but she has
some uncharitable thoughts about Miss Hawkins’s inferior connections. She
has difficulty persuading Harriet to share her coolness, however. Only
the topic of Mr. Martin puts Mr. Elton out of Harriet’s mind. 	Harriet is flustered when Mr. Martin’s sister leaves
her a note at Mrs. Goddard’s. Emma decides that Harriet should return
the visit but stay only a brief time in order to reinforce the distance
that Emma, despite a twinge of conscience, believes Harriet must
maintain from the Martin family. Summary: Chapter 23  Emma takes Harriet to visit the Martins. Ahead of time,
they agree that Emma is to return and retrieve Harriet after fifteen
minutes. Harriet has a friendly and emotional visit with Mr. Martin’s
mother and sister, but when the visit is cut short, it is clear
the Martins understand that they have been slighted. Though pained,
Emma still believes she is doing what is best for Harriet. 	Emma’s spirits are revived by a meeting with Mr. and
Mrs. Weston, who bring the news that Frank Churchill’s arrival is
imminent. The following day, Emma unexpectedly meets Frank at Hartfield,
and she is pleased to find that he is very good-looking, bright, and
charming. Frank has just the right compliment for everyone, especially
Mrs. Weston, which pleases Emma. Emma can see that Mr. Weston hopes
that she and Frank might form an attachment, and she wonders if
the thought has occurred to Frank. When his father departs on an
errand, Frank leaves to call on his acquaintance from Weymouth,
Jane Fairfax. Summary: Chapter 24  Frank Churchill and Mrs. Weston visit Hartfield the next
day, and Emma is pleased by Frank’s warmth toward his stepmother.
He seems genuinely interested in everything about Highbury as the three
walk about the village, especially in the sites that are meaningful
to his father. Encountering an unused ballroom, he suggests that they
should organize a dance, and he dismisses Emma’s protestations about
the village’s lack of worthy families. 	Emma inquires about Frank’s visit with the Bateses, and
the two share impressions of Jane. Frank says that he finds her
unattractive and reserved. He thinks, however, that she is a talented
musician and affirms that they saw a good deal of each other in
Weymouth. Emma shares her theory about Jane and Mr. Dixon, which
Frank seems to resist, but then he gives in to Emma’s greater knowledge
of Jane. On the whole, Emma finds Frank even more to her liking
than she expected, possessing his father’s warmth and sociability
and lacking the proud airs one might acquire from the Churchills. "
Chapters 31–33 ,"Summary: Chapter 31  Emma imagines the course that her and Frank’s love affair
will run. In her mind, her fantasy always ends with her refusing
Frank. She believes she loves him, but not so much that her happiness
depends upon him, and that he loves her, but that his feelings are
probably changeable. She reads his first letter to Mrs. Weston after
returning to Enscombe and admires the genuineness of the warm feelings Frank
expresses for Highbury. His brief mention of Harriet makes Emma
speculate that Harriet could replace her in his affections, but she
reaffirms her resolution to cease matchmaking. 	Village gossip turns to Mr. Elton, who will soon arrive
in Highbury with his new bride. Harriet is flustered by the prospect
of Elton’s return, and Emma suggests that if Harriet will not forget Elton
for her own sake, she should do so for Emma’s, for Harriet’s persistent
attachment is a reminder of Emma’s guilt. Harriet repents, and Emma
is moved by the warmth of Harriet’s love for her. Emma concludes
that tenderness of heart, which Harriet possesses and which Emma
believes she herself lacks, is tremendously valuable. Summary: Chapter 32  Mr. Elton returns with his bride, and Emma decides that
she and Harriet should visit the newlyweds early on in order to
reestablish normal social relations. In this first meeting and shortly
thereafter Emma reserves judgment on Mrs. Elton, and attributes
Mr. Elton’s lack of ease to the awkwardness of the situation. When
the couple returns the visit and comes to Hartfield, Emma is able
to observe Mrs. Elton at greater length, and Emma is horrified by
the over-familiarity of her manners. Mrs. Elton is attached to superficial tokens
of wealth, such as her sister and brother-in-law’s “barouche-landau”
(carriage); she presumes to take Emma under her social wing; and
she prides herself on the inner “resources” of self-worth and foresight
that she clearly lacks. Mr. Woodhouse, never particularly discerning,
considers the new bride pleasant enough and expresses guilt that
he has not visited her. He cannot understand Emma’s consternation
when he suggests that “[a] bride, you know, my dear, is always the
first in company,” and that a bride receives the utmost in politeness
and good manners. Summary: Chapter 33  Emma continues to dislike Mrs. Elton, who, noting Emma’s
reserve, begins to return the sentiment. Emma assumes that Mr. Elton
has told his wife something of the unfortunate episode with her
and Harriet, to whom the Eltons are especially rude. Mrs. Elton
takes on Jane Fairfax as her project, attempting to bring her out
socially. Emma is puzzled that Jane refuses another invitation to
join Mr. and Mrs. Campbell and Mr. and Mrs. Dixon in Ireland. She
is also puzzled that Jane accepts Mrs. Elton’s attentions, and she
discusses Jane’s actions with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley. Mr.
Knightley defends Jane’s acceptance of Mrs. Elton’s attentions,
and Emma takes the opportunity to probe Mr. Knightley on his feelings
for Jane, telling him, “The extent of your admiration may take you
by surprise one day or other.” Knightley seems flustered, uneasy,
and embarrassed and wonders whether Emma has been playing matchmaker
for him. She assures him that she has not, and he insists her that
he is not in love with Jane—for one thing, Jane is too reserved. Emma
is satisfied that she has been right about Knightley’s feelings for
Jane and that Mrs. Weston has been wrong, but Mrs. Weston wonders
if his eagerness in denying it indicates otherwise. Analysis: Chapters 31–33 In these chapters, Emma’s imaginative preoccupations again
shift their focus from meddling in others’ lives to understanding
the intrigue in her own. Earlier in the novel, Emma occupies herself
by envisaging Jane Fairfax’s supposed affair with Mr. Dixon, but
Jane’s reserve and Emma’s growing compassion for her have made this
line of speculation less worthwhile for Emma; now, for the first
time in the novel, Emma imagines herself as the heroine of her own
plot. Even so, her sentiments for Frank Churchill are no more real
than the feelings that she wrongly attributes to Mr. Elton, Jane,
and Mr. Knightley. Notably, her feelings for Frank flourish only
in his absence, which leaves Emma not unhappy but “busy and cheerful.” She
relishes the chance to envision her and Frank’s courtship, picturing
“a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment,
fancying interesting dialogues, and inventing elegant letters.”
She does not seem to relish the prospect of a courtship itself. 	Meanwhile, Mrs. Elton seems like a crude parody of the
earlier Emma, exhibiting Emma’s mistakes in an exaggerated form.
Mrs. Elton is constantly in search of young women to whom she can attach
herself and introduce into her society, and she holds matchmaking
an important goal. Emma immediately resents Mrs. Elton’s presumptuousness
in thinking she can make matches between strangers, and Mrs. Elton’s
blunt, outspoken nature makes us share Emma’s resentment. Still,
no great difference exists between Mrs. Elton’s behavior toward
Jane and Emma’s behavior toward Harriet, though Emma herself cannot
recognize the similarity. Both Emma and Mrs. Elton are guilty of
presumption. "
Chapters 40–42 ,"Summary: Chapter 40  Harriet comes to tell Emma that her infatuation with Mr.
Elton has passed and to relinquish the trinkets she has kept to
remember him by. First, she shows Emma a bit of court-plaster (used
at the time as a bandage) that she had lent to Mr. Elton when he
cut himself. He had used what he needed but discarded the rest,
which Harriet then kept. Emma feels guilty in recalling that she
had lied and said that she did not have any court-plaster, so that
Harriet would have the opportunity to be Elton’s healer. Harriet’s
second trinket is a useless bit of pencil Elton had discarded. She
throws both items into the fire, and Emma hopes that Frank might
take Elton’s place. Her hopes seem to be rewarded when, during another
conversation, Harriet says she will never marry, inciting Emma’s
suspicion that Harriet does not think that she will marry because
she is interested in someone of a higher class. After some hesitation,
Emma asks if Harriet has feelings for someone of higher rank. Harriet
says yes, and Emma comments that she is not surprised, given the
service that this person rendered Harriet. Emma says that they must
not discuss it anymore, and she advises Harriet to be cautious but
not to give up all hope. Summary: Chapter 41  Mr. Knightley begins to suspect that there is some secret
understanding between Frank and Jane. During a walk with Emma, Harriet,
Mr. and Mrs. Weston, Frank, Jane, and Miss Bates, Knightley witnesses
a strange exchange. Frank asks Mrs. Weston if anything has come
of Mr. Perry’s plan to buy a carriage. She has no idea what he is
talking about, and he swears that she wrote of it in a letter to him
some months ago. She denies it, and Frank decides he must have dreamed
it. Miss Bates remembers that there was talk of the Perrys getting
a carriage at her house (with Jane present) but that it was a secret.
Mr. Knightley observes Frank trying to catch Jane’s eye after this. 	The party reaches Hartfield, and Emma persuades everyone
to come in for tea. A word game ensues, which Mr. Knightley watches. Frank
constructs the word “blunder” using alphabet tiles, which he shows
to Jane. Then he constructs the word “Dixon,” shows it to Emma,
who laughs, and then shows it to Jane, who pushes the puzzle away
in anger. When the party breaks up, Knightley stays behind to speak
to Emma—he knows that everyone considers her the object of Frank’s
affection, and he wishes to warn her. Knightley asks Emma about
the “Dixon” joke, and, embarrassed, she refuses to explain. He tells
her his suspicion about Jane and Frank, and she laughs at him, stating
unequivocally that she can answer for Frank’s indifference to Jane.
Knightley is silenced and irritated by Emma’s implication that she
is in Frank’s confidence. Summary: Chapter 42  An outing to Box Hill is planned, but it has to be postponed
because of a lame horse. Mr. Knightley half-jokingly suggests that
the party come to his estate instead. Mrs. Elton seizes upon the
idea, and Knightley has to be firm to prevent her from planning
all the details. Meanwhile, the lame horse heals, and it is decided
that the Box Hill party will follow the one at Donwell Abbey, Knightley’s
estate. At Donwell Abbey, Emma enjoys examining Knightley’s house
and grounds. She overhears Jane resisting a governess “situation”
that Mrs. Elton has found for her. Walking through the garden, Emma finds
Harriet and Knightley looking out over the Martin family home and
thinks the two an odd grouping, but is nevertheless convinced that
Harriet is in good hands. Mrs. Weston is worried by the fact that
Frank is late coming from Richmond. At the house, Emma encounters
an agitated Jane, who asks her to tell everyone else that she has
walked home. Frank then turns up out of humor and in the course
of conversation says that he would like to go abroad. Emma teases
him out of his mood, and he promises to join the Box Hill trip. Analysis: Chapters 40–42 Even though Emma has resolved to use more discretion in
promoting a match between Harriet and Frank than she used when encouraging
Harriet’s affection for Mr. Elton, she manages to cause a misunderstanding
precisely because she shies away from explicit statements. When
Emma says of Harriet’s new object of affection, “The service he
rendered you was enough to warm your heart,” she is referring to
Frank, who saved Harriet from the Gypsies. Harriet, however, thinks
of Mr. Knightley, who saved her from humiliation by asking her to
dance. 	In the way it keeps us in the dark about the truth of
various characters’ feelings,  "
Chapters 34–36 ,"Summary: Chapter 34  Fulfilling a social obligation, Emma plans a dinner party
for Mrs. Elton. Harriet asks to be excused from attending, which
gives Emma the opportunity to ease her conscience regarding Jane
Fairfax, who, at Harriet’s announced absence, is promptly invited
to fill the empty eighth seat. Mr. John Knightley is also included
because he will be in Highbury, accompanying his two eldest sons
on a visit to their aunt and grandfather. 	At the party, Mr. John Knightley gently reproaches Jane
for fetching letters from the post office that morning in the rain.
Jane acts as if the situation is not a big deal but ends up blushing
and watery-eyed, and soon the rest of the party begins discussing
the matter. Mrs. Elton insists that her servant should be given
the task of retrieving Jane’s letters, and Jane firmly resists.
The conversation moves to handwriting. Mr. Knightley praises Emma’s
penmanship but dissents when she praises the penmanship of Frank
Churchill. Jane’s eagerness to fetch her own letters rouses Emma’s
suspicions, but she decides not to trouble Jane by questioning her. Summary: Chapter 35  The women gather in the drawing room after dinner, and
Mrs. Elton pursues the subject of letter-retrieval with Jane. She
also insists on helping Jane find a governess position, though Jane
explains that she will not seek a place until after she sees the
Campbells in midsummer. The men come in, and Mr. Weston, who has
been on business in London, appears. He brings a letter from Frank,
reporting that Mrs. Churchill has decided that the household should
make an extended visit in London. This news means that Frank will
be able to be in Highbury a good deal. Mr. and Mrs. Weston are pleased, Emma
is somewhat agitated, and Mr. Knightley seems unexcited by the news. Summary: Chapter 36  Mr. Weston and Mrs. Elton have a long-winded conversation
in which they pursue comically different purposes. Mrs. Elton fishes for
compliments and goes on about Maple Grove, the estate where her
wealthy brother and sister-in-law live. Mr. Weston talks about Frank
and explains the illness of Frank’s aunt (and Mr. Weston’s sister-in-law),
Mrs. Churchill. Before the conversation becomes too heated, they
are interrupted by tea. Mr. John Knightley gives Emma final instructions
regarding his sons and wonders if they will be in the way at Hartfield,
now that Emma has become so social. She rejects John Knightley’s
implication and insists that she is more of a homebody than Mr.
(George) Knightley, who seems pleased and amused by the assertion. Analysis: Chapters 34–36 Austen’s use of three chapters to narrate a single dinner
party marks an interesting narrative development for English literature.
In novels by previous writers, the description of the events of
a dinner party would have taken up at most a page or two, but Austen
turns the dinner party into an opportunity to trace extensively
the ins and outs of human personality and interaction. In doing
so, she provides a model for later writers as disparate as Henry
James and Virginia Woolf. 	During the dinner party, we are given our first extended
view of Jane Fairfax, who begins to come out of her reserved shell
and speak more. Her well-crafted comments exemplify an ideal balance between
openness and propriety. For example, when Mr. John Knightley observes,
“When you have lived to my age, you will begin to think letters
are never worth going through the rain for,” Jane answers, “I must
not hope to be ever situated as you are, in the midst of every dearest
connection, and therefore I cannot expect that simply growing older
should make me indifferent about letters.” This answer is politely
vague but also expresses real emotion. It engages our pity, but
it tactfully avoids any suggestion of self-pity on Jane’s part.
Furthermore, when she firmly resists Mrs. Elton’s aggressive offers
of assistance, we realize that Jane’s quietness and reserve do not
indicate that she is dull or passive—she clearly has a mind of her own.
In fact, Jane is the character who voices the novel’s most explicit
social protest, which seems to come directly from Austen herself.
Jane speaks against the “governess-trade,” which involves “the sale,
not quite of human flesh, but of human intellect.” She admits that
offices that advertise for governess positions are less morally
deplorable than slave traders, but she adds, “[B]ut as to the greater
misery of the victims, I do not know where it lies.” "
Chapters 43–45 ,"Summary: Chapter 43  
 The Box Hill trip is not a success. Mr. and Mrs. Elton
keep to themselves; Mr. Knightley, Miss Bates, and Jane form a second
exclusive party; and Emma stays with Harriet and Frank. Emma is
disappointed by Harriet’s and Frank’s dullness. Later, Frank becomes excessively
lively and gallant. Emma is confident that there is nothing behind
his flirtations, but she is aware that others can pick up on their
flirtation. The party sits about listlessly, and Frank says that Emma
demands to know what they are thinking of. Mrs. Elton is offended
by Frank’s deference to Emma, and Knightley asks dryly if she would  	Frank comments that sometimes matches made in public
places become regrettable on further acquaintance and that, as a
result, Mr. and Mrs. Elton are lucky that they are compatible. Jane
demurs and leaves for a walk with her aunt and Mr. Knightley. Emma,
left with Frank, grows tired of his flattery. Later, Mr. Knightley
takes Emma aside and reprimands her for her conduct toward Miss
Bates, reminding Emma that Miss Bates has had an unfortunate life
and deserves compassion. Emma has never felt “so agitated, so mortified,
[so] grieved” in her life; she cries almost all the way home. Summary: Chapter 44  On reflection, Emma decides that the Box Hill party was
a disaster. Still feeling horrible about her treatment of Miss Bates,
Emma soothes her conscience by visiting the Bateses first thing
the following morning. Miss Bates’s humility and kindness are a
further reproach to Emma’s bad behavior. During Emma’s visit, Jane remains
in the bedroom with a headache. 	Jane has just accepted the governess position recommended
by Mrs. Elton, and Emma expresses surprise and genuine concern for the
unhappiness Jane’s departure must cause everyone. Jane will leave
within a fortnight (two weeks). Emma is surprised to learn that
Frank departed the previous evening for Richmond, and she is struck
by the difference between Mrs. Churchill’s power and Jane’s. She
is ashamed of her earlier conjectures about Jane’s relationship with
Mr. Dixon. Summary: Chapter 45  Emma returns to Hartfield to discover that Mr. Knightley
and Harriet have arrived in her absence. Knightley is about to depart
for London to visit John and Isabella. His hastiness surprises Emma. Mr.
Woodhouse inquires about Emma’s visit with the Bateses, and Emma
blushes and exchanges a glance with Knightley. She believes he understands
her feelings and forgives her. He makes an unusual gesture, taking
her hand and almost kissing it. She is gratified, though a little
puzzled about his scruple in completing the kiss. 	The next day, unexpected news arrives: Mrs. Churchill
has died. Emma thinks this event may improve Harriet’s chances with
Frank. Meanwhile, she attempts to provide assistance to Jane, inviting
her to Hartfield, sending her healthful foods, and attempting to
visit her. Jane pleads ill health, but Emma hears that Jane has
been taking outside exercise, and she feels hurt that Jane seems
to be particularly avoiding her. "
Chapters 37–39 ,"Summary: Chapter 37  Emma thinks about her agitation upon hearing of Frank’s
impending arrival and decides that she feels such apprehension more
on his behalf than her own—her attachment to him is not very strong. When
she sees him again, he is friendly and spirited but visits for only
fifteen minutes. Frank’s short visit convinces Emma that his feelings
as well must have weakened. Because of his aunt’s demands, Frank
is kept away for ten days after this first visit. Mrs. Churchill eventually
determines that her family must move from London to Richmond, which
places Frank closer to Highbury. Mr. Weston is delighted to have
his son nearer, and a date is set for the long-postponed ball. Summary: Chapter 38  The day of the ball arrives. Emma is invited by Mr. Weston
to come early and give her opinion on the arrangements, and she
believes that this opportunity will give some privacy to her second
meeting with Frank, who will be with his father. But Emma is not
the only one of Mr. Weston’s “favourites” that he has entreated
to come early, and all the while Frank seems excited but restless,
constantly moving to see who has arrived. Finally, when Jane and
Miss Bates arrive, Frank rushes out to help them with umbrellas.
Mrs. Elton pronounces Frank a very fine young man. Miss Bates overwhelms everyone
with exclamations of gratitude and pleasure. Frank tells Emma that
he dislikes Mrs. Elton and her familiar manner with Jane, and he
runs off again to ask his father when the dancing will begin. 	Mr. and Mrs. Weston suddenly realize that Mrs. Elton
expects to be asked to lead the dance and that they cannot give
Emma that honor, as they had hoped. Despite this slight disappointment,
Emma enjoys the beginning of the festivities, though she is disturbed
that Mr. Knightley will not dance. She admires the figure he cuts
among the other men, and he notices that he is watching her. The
ball is a success, and only one episode mars Emma’s enjoyment. During
one dance, Harriet is left without a partner, and Mr. Elton, the
one dancer who is disengaged, pointedly refuses to ask her. Mr.
Knightley soothes Harriet’s embarrassment by asking her to dance,
and Emma is very pleased with him. Later, she expresses her gratitude, and
he asks her why the Eltons are her enemies. She admits that she wanted
Mr. Elton to marry Harriet and acknowledges that Knightley was right
about his character. Knightley in return admits that Harriet has
more admirable qualities than he originally thought. Emma and Knightley
cement their new mutual understanding with a dance. Summary: Chapter 39  Emma looks back on her talk with Mr. Knightley at the
ball with pleasure, and she rejoices that the Eltons’ rudeness has
cured Harriet of her infatuation with Mr. Elton. Suddenly, Frank
appears with Harriet, fainting, on his arm. When revived, Harriet
tells the story of how she was walking with a friend, Miss Bickerton,
when a Gypsy child approached to beg from them. Miss Bickerton,
frightened, ran away, but Harriet was unable to follow because of
a cramp she had gotten at the ball. Just as she started to panic,
a group of Gypsies surrounded her and demanded money. Frank happened
to be walking along and frightened the Gypsies away. Emma cannot
help but wonder whether this romantic circumstance might make Harriet
and Frank interesting to each other. The episode alarms Mr. Woodhouse and
is occasion for gossip, but the Gypsies leave the neighborhood and
no harm is done. Analysis: Chapters 37–39 Emma’s honest reflections about her lack of substantive
feelings for Frank reveal her growing maturity. She no longer sees
him as a character in the scenes she imagines for herself, someone
who is important simply because he gives her the opportunity to
show off her accomplishments and elegance. She recognizes that if
their two-month separation has not cooled his love, “there were
dangers and evils before her: caution for him and for herself would
be necessary.” Rather than anticipating a dramatic scene, she now
hopes that “she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration. That
would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance.”
Emma’s decision to observe Frank to see how he feels, rather than
to begin with an assumption about how he feels, enables her to understand
that Frank is not in love with her. The narrator makes clear that
Emma’s vanity is not at issue in this case—she is relieved, not
offended, that Frank’s feelings are cooled, and at the dance, she seems
to find more interest in puzzling about his odd mood than in courting
his attention. When Frank and Emma dance, instead of imagining how
elegant they look to others, she admires how elegant Mr. Knightley
looks. Emma has become more concerned with observing others, and
less concerned with being observed by others. 	The Gypsies Harriet describes encountering in Chapter  "
Chapters 46–48 ,"Summary: Chapter 46  Mr. Weston arrives to escort Emma to see Mrs. Weston—clearly something
is amiss. Assured that Mrs. Weston is well, Emma’s first concern
is for Isabella’s family and for Mr. Knightley in London, but Mr.
Weston assures her that the news does not involve them. At Randalls,
Emma is greeted by Mrs. Weston, who explains that Frank has just
revealed that he and Jane have been secretly engaged. Emma is shocked,
embarrassed by the things she has said to Frank about Jane, and
concerned for Harriet’s feelings. 	Emma quickly relieves Mrs. Weston by assuring her that
she has no feelings for Frank. She is angry, however, about his
behavior toward her and Jane. Mrs. Weston defends her stepson, telling Emma
that there were misunderstandings between him and Jane and that
he will be writing her a letter detailing the extenuating circumstances.
Mr. Churchill has given his consent to the match, though he has
requested that it remain secret until more time has passed after
his wife’s death. Mr. Weston enters the room, and Emma assures him
that the news of Frank’s engagement has not caused her any pain. Summary: Chapter 47  
 	Emma is filled with concern for Harriet. She is angrier
at herself than she is at Frank, because she believes that she should
have discouraged Harriet’s attachment to him. Jane’s behavior since
her arrival in Highbury is also put into perspective. Emma realizes
that Jane has been avoiding her because she has seen her as a rival.
Emma dreads telling Harriet the news, but when Harriet arrives at
Hartfield she has already heard the story from Mr. Weston. Emma
is surprised at Harriet’s composure, and it turns out that Harriet
never cared for Frank; she has been harboring feelings for Mr. Knightley.
Harriet knows that Mr. Knightley is of higher rank than she, but
she affirms that Emma has given her hope that she may raise herself
enough to be acceptable to him. 	Emma makes a startling discovery—she herself is in love
with Mr. Knightley! She conceals her emotion from Harriet, asking
Harriet whether she has reason to believe that Knightley returns
her feelings. Harriet recounts a number of instances in which Knightley
has shown her special attention, many of which Emma’s memory corroborates.
When Harriet departs, Emma is left to reflect that she has been
wrong about everything, including her own heart. Now Knightley may
debase himself by marrying Harriet, and she has made it all possible. Summary: Chapter 48  Emma rethinks all of the events of the past months. She
realizes that it has always been important to her to be “first”
with Mr. Knightley and that he has always had special concern for
her, but she cannot believe he could return her feelings, especially
when he has just been so angry with her about her rudeness to Miss
Bates. She still believes she would not marry him, even if he asked,
because she cannot leave her father. She anticipates having the
opportunity to observe him and Harriet together. 	Mrs. Weston arrives to report that she has just visited
with Jane and that Jane admitted to having suffered a good deal
since entering into the secret engagement. She blames herself for
her misjudgment and acknowledges Emma’s kindness during her sickness.
Hearing this account, Emma again expresses anger at Frank’s behavior.
Mrs. Weston again defends him, though she has not yet received his explanatory
letter, but Emma is too distracted by her thoughts about Mr. Knightley
to pay attention. Emma regrets once more that she was not a better
friend to Jane, as Knightley had advised, and she reflects on how
desolate life will be without Knightley’s constant visits to Hartfield. "
Chapters 49–51 ,"Summary: Chapter 49  
 	Emma goes for a walk in the garden. To her surprise,
Mr. Knightley joins her. He has just returned from London. She worries
that Knightley will confess his feelings for Harriet, and she offers
her news about Frank and Jane’s secret engagement. Knightley already knows
about it and offers his consolation, but Emma assures him she has
never had feelings for Frank. She explains and expresses regret
for her behavior, and Knightley is strangely silent. Finally, he admits
he may have underrated Frank and expresses envy at his circumstances.
Worried that Knightley is about to discuss Harriet, Emma quickly
silences him. He is mortified, and seeing his pain Emma invites
him to speak after all, saying she will be glad to hear him as a
friend. He says he does not wish her friendship and declares his
love. She is surprised, thrilled, and by the time they reach the house
they are engaged to marry. Knightley is surprised as well—he was
convinced that Emma was in love with Frank; he departed for London
to cool his feelings for her, and he has returned thinking she would
need comfort. He has moved from resigned despair to perfect happiness
in half an hour. Summary: Chapter 50  Emma can barely conceal her feelings as she and Mr. Knightley
join her father for tea. That night, Emma lies awake worrying about Harriet
and her father. She decides she will write a letter to Harriet explaining
what has happened and arrange for Harriet to visit Isabella in London
to give both of them some time to adjust to the new situation. She
decides that she and Knightley must postpone their wedding until
after her father dies. 	Mrs. Weston forwards Emma a letter from Frank in which
he explains that all of his actions, including his attentions to
Emma, were guided by a need to maintain the secrecy of his engagement
to Jane. He apologizes for his behavior, but explains that he could
tell Emma was not attached to him, and says that he was under the impression
that Emma already knew about him and Jane. He adores Jane and is
miserable that he has made her suffer. The couple quarreled the
morning of the Donwell Abbey party because Jane was upset about
his behavior toward Emma, thinking it an inappropriate way to maintain
their secret. Frank was upset about Jane’s caution, which he interpreted
as coldness. Frank then left for Richmond, and Jane wrote to him
to break off the engagement. He received the letter from Jane the
morning his aunt died, and in the flurry of subsequent correspondence
failed to send his conciliating response to her. She sent his letters
back to him, indicating that he could return her letters at her
governess post. This was the first news Frank had heard of her new
position, and he threw himself at his uncle’s mercy, receiving approval
for the match. He then sped to Highbury to find Jane very ill. They
reconciled, and Frank admits that he is happier than he deserves
to be. Summary: Chapter 51  Emma, in her own happiness, cannot help but forgive Frank.
When Knightley comes to her, she shares the letter with him. He
reads the letter, telling Emma his impressions as he goes along,
and he is less softened than she but willing to admit that Frank
has some good qualities. He and Emma discuss her father, and he
agrees that Emma cannot leave Hartfield and that Mr. Woodhouse cannot
be expected to move to Donwell Abbey. He suggests that he move to
Hartfield, and Emma is moved by his sacrifice. She promises to think
it over, and soon likes the plan—her only sadness is that this engagement and
relocation will estrange her and Harriet further. Analysis: Chapters 49–51 Nearly every sentence that passes between Emma and Knightley
in Chapter  	The emotional release of Chapter  "
Chapters 13–15 ,"Summary: Chapter 13  The Woodhouses and Knightleys are invited to the Westons’
for Christmas Eve dinner. Harriet and Mr. Elton are also included,
but Harriet comes down with a sore throat and is forced to miss
the gathering. Emma meets Mr. Elton while visiting Harriet and is pleased
by his attentions to her friend, but she remains puzzled that he
refuses her suggestion to skip the party since Harriet will not
be there. Mr. John Knightley witnesses the exchange and suggests
to Emma that Mr. Elton has feelings for her. Amused, Emma dismisses the
suggestion. When she and Mr. Elton travel to the gathering in the same
carriage, she is surprised that Mr. Elton’s concern for Harriet gives
way to cheerful anticipation of the evening ahead. Summary: Chapter 14  Entering the party, Emma attempts to put Mr. Elton’s strange
behavior out of her mind, but his constant hovering presence makes
her worry that Mr. John Knightley’s suggestion that Mr. Elton cares
for her may be correct. Meanwhile, Mr. Weston announces that Frank Churchill
is due to visit in early January. Emma feels some interest in this
news because she has half-seriously thought of Frank as a potential
suitor, though she does not anticipate giving up her vow to remain
single. Mrs. Weston confides to Emma that she has some anxiety about
meeting her stepson, and she fears Mrs. Churchill will prevent him
from coming. She and Emma speculate about the situation at Enscombe,
the Churchill estate, and Emma wonders why a young man should be
so dependent upon the impulses of his guardian. Summary: Chapter 15  Mr. Elton joins Emma in the drawing room and displeases
her by acting more concerned with her health than with Harriet’s.
John Knightley’s report that it has begun snowing leads to a small
crisis, and Mr. Woodhouse and Isabella are beside themselves with
worry about traveling the three-quarters of a mile home. Mr. Knightley assesses
the situation and reassures everyone that they will make it back
safely. 	In the confusion created by the party breaking up, Emma
finds herself alone in one of the carriages with Mr. Elton. He immediately declares
his love for her and proposes. Hoping that he is merely drunk, Emma
attempts to remind him that Harriet is the true object of his affections.
Astonished, Elton assures Emma that he has never been interested
in Harriet. Moreover, he is convinced that Emma has known of and
encouraged his sentiments. Emma sharply rebukes him and refuses
his proposal, and the two travel the remainder of the journey in
angry silence. Analysis: Chapters 13–15 Emma’s belief that she is different from others cannot
merely be attributed to her sense of superiority; it also results
from her ambition to make her life more interesting and more useful
than the limitations of village life seem to allow. Observing and
imagining the destinies of other lives exercises her intellect.
We might think of Emma as a kind of novelist creating plots for
the characters that people her world. In this sense, she may be
closer to Austen than her mistakes would lead us to believe. In
fact, Emma is somewhat prudish, afraid to consider marriage for
herself, despite her belief that “a good match” is the key to happiness
for her friends. Alert to what she believes are the subtleties of
flirtation between Harriet and Mr. Elton, she is incapable or unwilling
to see that she might be engaging in such social games herself. 	Emma’s confrontation with Mr. Elton is the novel’s first
major crisis. The true turning point is not Elton’s proposal, however,
but his accusation that Emma has known that she was the object of
his affections all along. He says, “I am sure you have seen and
understood me,” and for the first time in the novel Emma is at a
loss for words, fiercely angry. This is the first instance in which
Emma is implicated in the social interactions that she believed
she was manipulating from a position of control and detachment.
She has understood her own calculating behavior as beyond reproach,
in a sense invisible, and suddenly she is seen and placed within
the society from which she believed she has separated herself, forced
to realize that she has been lying to both Harriet and herself. "
Chapters 52–55 ,"Summary: Chapter 52  Harriet agrees to Emma’s plan to send her to London on
the pretense that she needs to see a dentist, which satisfies Emma
since she does not want to hurt Harriet with news of Emma and Mr.
Knightley’s engagement. Emma decides not to tell her father of her
engagement until Mrs. Weston, who is pregnant, has given birth to
her baby. Meanwhile, she pays a visit to Jane. They are unable to
speak openly because Mrs. Elton is there, and Jane’s engagement
is still supposed to be a secret. However, Emma interprets some
of Mrs. Elton’s remarks and expressions as ostentatious indications
that Mrs. Elton is in on the secret of Jane and Frank’s engagement. 	Mr. Elton turns up, annoyed that Mr. Knightley has missed
a meeting with him. Emma decides he must be waiting for her at Hartfield
and leaves. When Jane walks her out, they are reconciled, each feeling
that she owes the other an apology, both full of goodwill. Summary: Chapter 53  Mrs. Weston safely delivers a baby girl, much to Emma’s
delight. Mr. Knightley reminisces about how headstrong Emma was
when she was a child. She expresses gratitude that he so often corrected her
mistakes, and he asserts that she would have done just as well without
him. Emma is grieved that she cannot speak more openly with him
about Harriet. Mr. John Knightley congratulates Mr. Knightley and
Emma on their engagement, and shocks the couple by saying that he
is not surprised by their news. 	Emma works up the courage to give her father the news.
Mr. Woodhouse is shocked, but he gradually begins to resign himself
to it. Mrs. Weston helps persuade him that his happiness will be increased
rather than diminished. She is surprised and overwhelmingly pleased
by the match. Mr. Weston shares the news with Jane and Miss Bates,
and soon Emma and Knightley’s engagement is the talk of Highbury.
Only the Eltons are displeased that Emma has made such a good match. Summary: Chapter 54  Mr. Knightley has news for Emma: Harriet is to marry Robert
Martin. Knightley had sent Mr. Martin to London with a package for
his brother while Harriet was there, and Mr. Martin began to spend time
with the family. Knightley worries that Emma is upset, but in fact
she is thrilled, amazed, and amused at Harriet’s rapid recovery. Emma
is thankful that she has not done Harriet greater injury, and she
is glad that soon she will no longer need to conceal Harriet’s emotional
state from Knightley. 	Emma and Mr. Knightley go to visit Randalls and find
Frank and Jane there. At first, Emma’s meeting with Frank is awkward,
but soon they are back on easy terms, joking about all that has
passed. Frank’s ability to speak lightly of all he and Jane have
suffered is not entirely approved by his fiancée, and Emma feels
Knightley’s superiority to Frank. "

Chapters 1–3 ,"Summary: Chapter 1  
 	The narrator opens the novel by introducing us to Emma
Woodhouse, a girl endowed with “some of the best blessings of existence,”
including good looks, intelligence, riches, and an affectionate father.
Emma’s only disadvantages are that she is slightly spoiled and that
she thinks “a little too well of herself.” Emma’s mother died before
Emma could form many memories of her, but her gentle governess,
Miss Taylor, provided a motherly love. After Emma’s older sister,
Isabella, was married and moved to London, Miss Taylor and Emma
became best friends. 	As the novel begins, Miss Taylor has just left Hartfield,
the estate of Emma and Mr. Woodhouse, to marry a widower named Mr. Weston,
and Emma is left without a companion. She attempts to comfort her
despondent father, who hates change, with the thought that they
will see the new Mrs. Weston often, but Emma only partially succeeds
in comforting herself. At this moment, neighborhood resident Mr.
Knightley, the brother of Isabella’s husband, pays a visit, having
returned from visiting their mutual relations in London. He affirms
the appropriateness of the match between Mr. Weston and Miss Taylor
and gently chides Emma when she claims credit. Emma declares that
she will repeat her matchmaking success by finding a wife for Mr.
Elton, the village rector. Summary: Chapter 2  The narrator recounts Mr. Weston’s history. His first
marriage was to a woman named Miss Churchill, who came from a higher
class than his. They had a son, named Frank, but the marriage was
overshadowed by the disapproval of Mrs. Weston’s brother and sister-in-law,
Mr. and Mrs. Churchill. When Mrs. Weston died after three years
of marriage, Frank was essentially adopted by Mr. and Mrs. Churchill
and made their heir. Mr. Weston, left impoverished by the expectations
of his first wife, spent the next twenty years of his life rebuilding
his fortune. He eventually purchased Randalls, the small estate
where he lives with the second Mrs. Weston. 	The village has always been curious to see Frank Churchill,
who writes a kind letter to Mrs. Weston indicating that he will
pay a visit to his father and stepmother. Summary: Chapter 3  The Woodhouses give a small dinner party, to which they
invite other members of their social circle: the widow Mrs. Bates;
her single, middle-aged daughter, Miss Bates; and Mrs. Goddard,
the mistress of the local boarding school. Mrs. Goddard brings one
of her boarders, Harriet Smith, a girl whose parentage is unknown.
Emma admires Harriet for her beauty and for her respect of Emma
and Hartfield. She resolves to pursue friendship with Harriet, and
to improve the naïve girl by detaching her from the inferior acquaintance
of the farming Martin family. She plans to introduce Harriet to
higher society. Analysis: Chapters 1–3 The narration of these opening chapters creates a complicated
portrait of Emma as a young, beautiful, clever, and confident character who
exercises her influence in a constricted and complex environment
and has much to learn about friendship, love, and the ways of the
world. Emma’s affection for Miss Taylor and her kindness to her foolish
and somewhat tiresome father reveal Emma’s capacity for true warmth
and generosity. But, at the same time, the narrator quickly alerts
us to the ways in which Emma is spoiled by her advantages and blinded
by her own self-regard. Most explicitly, we are told at the novel’s
beginning: "
Chapters 25–27 ,"Summary: Chapter 25  Emma’s good opinion of Frank Churchill is injured when
he makes a day trip to London just to have his hair cut. Though
Emma does not feel inclined to give up her vow to remain single,
she decides that Frank is pleasing enough that she does not mind
being associated with him in other people’s minds. Mr. Knightley
thinks Frank is a silly young man, just as he had suspected. 	Meanwhile, an invitation from the Coles, successful tradespeople
who live in Highbury, creates a conundrum for Emma. She had originally
decided that she would not accept an invitation from the nouveau-riche
family, but when everyone except the Woodhouses receives an invitation
to a dinner party at the Coles’ home, Emma feels left out. When
an invitation arrives, she decides to accept it. Summary: Chapter 26  Emma arrives at the Coles’ party behind Mr. Knightley.
Because Knightley usually walks, Emma is surprised that he has come
in his carriage. At dinner, it is revealed that Jane Fairfax has
received the mysterious gift of a pianoforte. People assume the
piano is from Colonel Campbell, but Emma tells Frank she suspects
that it is a gift from Mr. Dixon. When Jane arrives later, she blushes
when questioned about the piano. 	Meanwhile, Mrs. Weston tells Emma that Mr. Knightley
brought his carriage so that he could convey Jane home. Mrs. Weston
suggests that a match may be forming between Jane and Mr. Knightley, but
Emma resists this supposition vigorously, explaining that she cannot
bear the thought of Mr. Knightley marrying because then her nephew,
George and Isabella’s son Henry, will not be able to inherit Donwell
Abbey, the Knightley estate in the town of the same name. Mrs. Weston
suspects that Mr. Knightley is the one who sent Jane the pianoforte. 	Emma and Jane sing and play the piano for the company,
with Frank accompanying. When Frank persuades Jane to sing one more song
after her voice has begun to grow hoarse, Mr. Knightley intervenes.
Emma questions Mr. Knightley about the carriage and pianoforte.
His answers convince her that he did not send the gift, but do not
enable her to decide if he has feelings for Jane. When impromptu dancing
begins, she is relieved that he does not ask Jane to dance. Emma
is also pleased that Frank immediately asks her and not Jane for
a dance. There is time for only two dances, however, before the party
breaks up. Frank comments to Emma that he is lucky the dancing had
to end; otherwise he would have found himself asking Jane Fairfax
for a dance. Summary: Chapter 27  Emma is thoroughly pleased with her evening at the Coles,
but she is uncertain about the appropriateness of telling Frank
about her suspicions about Jane or acknowledging the superiority
of Jane’s musical abilities. At the Coles’ party, Harriet heard
that Mr. Martin had dined with the Cox family, and there is a rumor
that a Cox daughter would like to marry Mr. Martin. To distract
and protect Harriet, Emma accompanies her on a shopping trip. They
then decide to pay a visit to the Bates household and run into Frank
and Mrs. Weston on their way. The visit seems to have been Frank’s
idea, but he offers to stay with Emma and send Mrs. Weston to make
the visit on her own. Emma sends him along, knowing that he will
later come see her at Hartfield, but Miss Bates then comes into
the shop to ask Emma to come give her opinion of Jane’s new pianoforte.
In her rambling, Miss Bates reveals that Mr. Knightley has sent
his last apples of the season to Jane, who is particularly fond
of them. "
Chapters 7–9 ,"Summary: Chapter 7  Harriet receives a letter from Mr. Martin proposing marriage
and goes directly to Emma to seek advice. Emma acts as if there
is obviously no doubt that Harriet should not accept, and she proceeds
to offer Harriet advice about the wording of her refusal. When it becomes
clear that Harriet is doubtful about her answer, Emma becomes somewhat
cold and disingenuously states, “I shall not give you any advice,
Harriet. . . . This is a point which you must settle with your own
feelings.” When, under Emma’s subtle guidance, Harriet states that
she will probably reject Mr. Martin, Emma immediately congratulates
her friend on having made the right decision and points out that
if Harriet had accepted him, then Emma would no longer be able to
be her friend. Harriet immediately affirms that the loss of Emma
is unthinkable, and the two of them draft a letter refusing the
proposal. It is clear that Harriet is pained by her decision and
cares for Mr. Martin, but Emma cheers her up with reminders of Mr.
Elton. Summary: Chapter 8  With Harriet at Mrs. Goddard’s preparing for an extended
visit to Hartfield, Mr. Knightley and Emma have the opportunity
for a lengthy conversation about Harriet and Mr. Martin. Knightley reveals
that Mr. Martin has consulted him about proposing to Harriet, and
Mr. Knightley makes it clear that he supports the match. Emma informs
him that the proposal has already been made and rejected, and she
insists that Mr. Martin is not Harriet’s equal. Knightley very nearly
loses his temper, and he insists upon Mr. Martin’s superiority to
Harriet in sense and “true gentility.” Knightley is especially displeased
by what he immediately guesses was Emma’s role in the rejection,
and he states flatly, “You have been no friend to Harriet Smith.”
Emma counters that Harriet’s beauty and good temper, along with
the possibility that she is the daughter of a gentleman, make her
a desirable match. Knightley tells Emma that if she thinks Mr. Elton
will marry Harriet, she is wrong, because Elton will only marry
a woman with money. Vexed with one another, Emma and Knightley part
ways. Emma is comforted by the return of Harriet, who has heard
a rumor that Elton is on an important errand regarding a lady. Summary: Chapter 9  Emma and Harriet have been collecting riddles (also called
“charades”) into a scrapbook, and when Mr. Elton returns from London with
the framed portrait of Harriet, he contributes one. Emma immediately
decodes the riddle and sees that its answer is the word “courtship.”
She translates the riddle for Harriet, who could not solve it herself,
but Harriet is nonetheless flattered by its meaning. Emma convinces
Harriet that the riddle foretells a proposal, and she copies the
riddle into Harriet’s book. After some discussion among the family
anticipating the upcoming Christmas visit of Isabella, Mr. John
Knightley, and their children, Emma tells Mr. Elton that she has
solved his charade and copied it into Harriet’s book. Elton is clearly
moved, and Emma concludes that his emotion comes from seeing his
riddle in Harriet’s book. Analysis: Chapters 7–9 Chapters  Emma’s conversation with Mr. Knightley, in Chapter  	Sharing riddles was a common genteel pastime in the early
nineteenth century, and the riddle in Chapter  "
Chapters 28–30 ,"Summary: Chapter 28  Emma enters the Bates’ sitting room and finds Frank occupied
with fixing Mrs. Bates’s glasses and Jane seated at the piano. Frank
asks Jane questions about how she imagines the piano came to her,
and his comment, “True affection only could have prompted it,” makes Jane
blush. Believing that Frank is teasing Jane unkindly about Mr. Dixon,
Emma whispers that he should stop, and she regrets having shared
her speculations about Jane with him. Mr. Knightley stops by to
check on Jane’s health but refuses to come in when he hears that Frank
is there. Summary: Chapter 29  While the Woodhouses are visiting Randalls, Frank and
Emma work on planning a ball so they can finish the dancing inaugurated at
the Coles’. They decide the room at Randalls is too small. Mr. Woodhouse
privately tells Mrs. Weston his concern that Frank is so thoughtless
about opening and shutting doors that he exposes Emma, Harriet,
and Mrs. Weston to dangerous drafts. The next solution proposed
by Frank on behalf of Mr. Weston is that the ball be given at the
Crown Inn. Though Frank does a poor job reassuring Mr. Woodhouse
that this plan will not give them all colds, Emma comforts her father,
and she agrees to the plan. There are further practical difficulties,
and Frank proposes he go fetch Miss Bates along with her niece,
whom Frank admits he does not immediately recollect, for advice.
By the time he returns, the difficulties have been resolved, the
date of the ball has been set, and Frank secures from Emma a promise
to dance the first two dances with him. Summary: Chapter 30  Emma is worried that Frank’s aunt, Mrs. Churchill, will
refuse Frank permission to stay on for the ball, which is scheduled
for a few days after his visit is scheduled to end. To everyone’s
relief, he receives this permission. Only Mr. Knightley refuses
to look forward to the ball: he does not seem interested in dancing.
Emma takes Knightley’s diffidence as further proof that he is not
interested in Jane, who in a rare moment of openness confesses how
much she looks forward to the ball. 	Two days later, Frank is called back to Enscombe because
his aunt is ill. The ball is postponed indefinitely, and Frank comes
to Emma to say goodbye. He is clearly dejected and speaks haltingly—for
a moment, it seems as if he is going to declare something serious. Interrupted
by his father, Frank departs, and Emma is depressed. Highbury society
is, it seems for Emma, severely diminished without Frank’s charms.
Emma concludes that she must be “a little in love” with Frank after
all. Analysis: Chapters 28–30 During Emma and Frank’s visit to the Bates’, Emma, Frank,
and Jane are all aware that the dialogue taking place has a subtext,
but Austen crafts Frank’s words so that the subtexts Emma and Jane read
differ from one another. At this point in the novel, our misperceptions
are likely to closely match Emma’s, and we follow her in believing
that Frank’s teasing of Jane about the origins of her piano cruelly
refers to Mr. Dixon. Though Emma gossips maliciously about Jane, her selfless
protectiveness of Jane when she believes Frank to be teasing her
shows that Emma’s willingness to amuse herself at the expense of
another has limits. When we later learn that the piano is actually
a gift from Frank, Jane’s secret fiancé, we realize that his teasing
is more good-natured, emphasizing his own gesture of affection. "
Chapters 4–6 ,"Summary: Chapter 4  Emma and Harriet strike up an immediate intimacy as Harriet replaces
Mrs. Weston as Emma’s companion on her habitual walks. Emma remains
unimpressed with Harriet’s intelligence but appreciates her willingness
to be guided. Emma encourages Harriet to tell everything about herself,
and their conversation soon centers on the Martin family, which
Harriet has visited frequently over the past two months. Emma is
alarmed to learn that the family includes an eligible bachelor,
Mr. Robert Martin, and fears that her friend may have feelings for
him. A match between Harriet and Mr. Martin would be unacceptable
to Emma because the Martins are farmers, and therefore, in her opinion,
socially beneath her new friend. She discourages Harriet from thinking
well of Mr. Martin by asking questions about his education and predicting
that any wife Mr. Martin takes will be too inferior to merit friendship
with Harriet. After they run into Mr. Martin on one of their walks,
Emma encourages Harriet to compare his manners with those of the
gentlemen they know, praising Mr. Elton’s manners as particularly
genteel. The narrator reveals that Emma determined during the party
at Hartfield to encourage a match between Harriet and Mr. Elton. Summary: Chapter 5  Mr. Knightley and Mrs. Weston converse about Emma’s new
friendship with Harriet. Knightley believes that the friendship
is dangerous for both parties. Harriet’s flattery, Knightley suspects,
will reinforce Emma’s self-regard, while Emma’s influence will injure Harriet’s
happiness, because Harriet “will grow just refined enough to be
uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstance have
placed her home.” Mrs. Weston disagrees, believing that Emma needs
Harriet’s companionship and that Emma’s company will improve Harriet.
She advises Knightley to keep his mouth shut, and the conversation
ends with speculation about what will become of Emma. Noting Emma’s
declaration that she will never marry and her lack of suitable prospects,
Knightley comments that he “should like to see Emma in love, and
in some doubt of a return; it would do her good.” Summary: Chapter 6  Emma continues to point out Mr. Elton’s finer qualities
to Harriet and is convinced that he is already in love with her
friend. Mr. Elton praises the graces that Harriet has gained in
Emma’s company, and he quickly seconds Emma’s idea to paint a watercolor
portrait of Harriet. As Emma paints, Mr. Elton is only too attentive
to her progress, and though Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley point
out that Emma has exaggerated Harriet’s beauty, Mr. Elton emphatically praises
the portrait’s likeness. He volunteers to take the watercolor to
London to be framed. All the while, Emma continues to believe that
Mr. Elton’s enthusiasm is for Harriet, though Mr. Elton makes comments
on Emma’s skill in rendering and improving on the beautiful subject. Analysis: Chapters 4–6 Over the course of these three chapters, we learn that
Emma is extremely class-conscious and also somewhat manipulative.
She unattractively dismisses Robert Martin because of his social
class, saying, “The yeomanry [the class of farmers who hold land
under long- term leases] are precisely the order of people with
whom I feel I can have nothing to do. A degree or two lower, and
a creditable appearance might interest me; I might hope to be useful
to their families in some way or another.” In other words, Emma
is only interested in people who are of her social class or so far
beneath her that she might, from a comfortable position of superiority,
flatter herself by being “useful” to them. Such superior usefulness
is what Emma attempts with Harriet, and she even lies to her friend
in order to manipulate her. Although Emma observes to herself that
Mr. Martin’s “appearance was very neat and he looked like a sensible
young man,” she tells Harriet, “He is very plain … remarkably plain,
but that is nothing compared to his entire want of gentility.” 	Mr. Knightley and Mrs. Weston make Emma seem more likable than
she makes herself seem. Because Knightley shows himself to have
good sense, and also because he is the one character willing to find
fault with Emma, he is the novel’s most reliable mouthpiece for Austen’s
views of Emma. His discussion of Emma shows that he genuinely cares
for her but views her as a child lacking sense and understanding
rather than as an equal. He believes that Emma has been “spoiled
by being the cleverest of her family” but respects her stubbornness
and independence. He also admits that though Emma is very pretty,
she is not vain about her looks; “her vanity lies another way.”
Knightley’s pointed criticisms are offset by Mrs. Weston’s dismissive
remarks that Emma is a caring daughter, sister, and friend who “will
make no lasting blunder.” 	Like Austen’s narration, the dialogue between characters
frequently contains a subtext available only to certain characters
or to the reader. For instance, when Emma says to Harriet, “I wish
you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, when ever [Mr. Martin] does marry—I
mean as to being acquainted with his wife … it does not follow that
he might marry anybody at all fit for you to notice,” we admire
the cleverness of Emma’s suggestion to Harriet that Mr. Martin is
beneath her, even as we disapprove of Emma’s action. Chapter  "
Chapters 16–18 ,"Summary: Chapter 16  
 	Back at Hartfield after her ride with Mr. Elton, Emma
plunges into self-recrimination as she looks back over the past
weeks. Her biggest regret concerns Harriet, whose feelings for Elton,
Emma realizes, are due mostly to Emma’s own encouragement. She decides
she need not pity Elton, because the artificiality of his addresses
suggests that he was more interested in her fortune than in herself.
She realizes that both of the Knightley brothers have been right
about Elton and that she has been wrong all along. Emma vows to
give up matchmaking, but she cannot stop herself from searching
for a new suitor for Harriet. 	The next morning, Emma is comforted by the reflection
that neither Elton’s nor Harriet’s feelings could have been very
strong and by the fact that no one else needs to know what has happened.
Several days of snow provide a respite, as everyone stays at home,
but Emma dreads telling Harriet what has happened. Summary: Chapter 17  Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley return to London, and Mr.
Elton writes Mr. Woodhouse to announce that he will spend the next
few weeks in the town of Bath. Relieved, Emma immediately visits
Harriet to explain what has happened. Emma’s sense of her own failures,
and Harriet’s modesty and sweetness in taking the news, give Emma
the temporary impression that Harriet, rather than herself, is “the
superior creature.” She moves Harriet to Hartfield and attempts
to comfort her and drive Elton out of Harriet’s mind. Emma tries
to prepare Harriet for the inevitable moment when they will see
Elton in their social circle after he returns from Bath. Summary: Chapter 18  Frank Churchill does not make his expected visit, to the
disappointment of Mrs. Weston in particular. Emma, preoccupied with
her other worries, does not mind, but she feels she must express
disappointment so that she will appear her usual self. Her warmth
in doing so gets her into an argument with Mr. Knightley about the young
man. Knightley expresses the same thought Emma has expressed: how
can a twenty-four-year-old man be prevented by his aunt from doing
his duty? In reply, Emma suggests that Knightley is a poor judge
of “the difficulties of dependence.” She expresses her sympathies
for Frank’s situation and her conviction that he would come if he
could, but Knightley counters that no sensible, honorable man would
be prevented from doing his duty. Emma predicts that Frank, when
he does arrive in Highbury, will be perfectly charming. Knightley
believes that Frank will be superficial and insufferable, and Knightley’s
prejudice against the stranger surprises Emma. Analysis: Chapters 16–18 Chapter  	However, Emma has not totally shed her former shortcomings. Emma’s
resolution to cease matchmaking is put in terms that suggest she
has gained a good deal of insight: “It was foolish, it was wrong,
to take so active a part in bringing two people together. It was
adventuring too far, assuming too much, making light of what ought
to be serious—a trick of what ought to be simple.” But soon she
is imagining new matches for Harriet, though she stops herself with
the recognition of her own relapse. Emma’s reflection that “there
had been no real affection either in [Elton’s] language or manners”
shows her continued sense of the superiority of her mind and manners
to Elton’s. She blames Elton probably more than he deserves for
her own mistakes, and her quick assumption that his feelings for
her were insincere seems self-serving. Her revised understanding
of Elton is accurate, but her refusal to implicate herself as party
to his misunderstanding shows that Emma’s self-understanding is
not complete. "
Chapters 31–33 ,"Summary: Chapter 31  Emma imagines the course that her and Frank’s love affair
will run. In her mind, her fantasy always ends with her refusing
Frank. She believes she loves him, but not so much that her happiness
depends upon him, and that he loves her, but that his feelings are
probably changeable. She reads his first letter to Mrs. Weston after
returning to Enscombe and admires the genuineness of the warm feelings Frank
expresses for Highbury. His brief mention of Harriet makes Emma
speculate that Harriet could replace her in his affections, but she
reaffirms her resolution to cease matchmaking. 	Village gossip turns to Mr. Elton, who will soon arrive
in Highbury with his new bride. Harriet is flustered by the prospect
of Elton’s return, and Emma suggests that if Harriet will not forget Elton
for her own sake, she should do so for Emma’s, for Harriet’s persistent
attachment is a reminder of Emma’s guilt. Harriet repents, and Emma
is moved by the warmth of Harriet’s love for her. Emma concludes
that tenderness of heart, which Harriet possesses and which Emma
believes she herself lacks, is tremendously valuable. Summary: Chapter 32  Mr. Elton returns with his bride, and Emma decides that
she and Harriet should visit the newlyweds early on in order to
reestablish normal social relations. In this first meeting and shortly
thereafter Emma reserves judgment on Mrs. Elton, and attributes
Mr. Elton’s lack of ease to the awkwardness of the situation. When
the couple returns the visit and comes to Hartfield, Emma is able
to observe Mrs. Elton at greater length, and Emma is horrified by
the over-familiarity of her manners. Mrs. Elton is attached to superficial tokens
of wealth, such as her sister and brother-in-law’s “barouche-landau”
(carriage); she presumes to take Emma under her social wing; and
she prides herself on the inner “resources” of self-worth and foresight
that she clearly lacks. Mr. Woodhouse, never particularly discerning,
considers the new bride pleasant enough and expresses guilt that
he has not visited her. He cannot understand Emma’s consternation
when he suggests that “[a] bride, you know, my dear, is always the
first in company,” and that a bride receives the utmost in politeness
and good manners. Summary: Chapter 33  Emma continues to dislike Mrs. Elton, who, noting Emma’s
reserve, begins to return the sentiment. Emma assumes that Mr. Elton
has told his wife something of the unfortunate episode with her
and Harriet, to whom the Eltons are especially rude. Mrs. Elton
takes on Jane Fairfax as her project, attempting to bring her out
socially. Emma is puzzled that Jane refuses another invitation to
join Mr. and Mrs. Campbell and Mr. and Mrs. Dixon in Ireland. She
is also puzzled that Jane accepts Mrs. Elton’s attentions, and she
discusses Jane’s actions with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley. Mr.
Knightley defends Jane’s acceptance of Mrs. Elton’s attentions,
and Emma takes the opportunity to probe Mr. Knightley on his feelings
for Jane, telling him, “The extent of your admiration may take you
by surprise one day or other.” Knightley seems flustered, uneasy,
and embarrassed and wonders whether Emma has been playing matchmaker
for him. She assures him that she has not, and he insists her that
he is not in love with Jane—for one thing, Jane is too reserved. Emma
is satisfied that she has been right about Knightley’s feelings for
Jane and that Mrs. Weston has been wrong, but Mrs. Weston wonders
if his eagerness in denying it indicates otherwise. Analysis: Chapters 31–33 In these chapters, Emma’s imaginative preoccupations again
shift their focus from meddling in others’ lives to understanding
the intrigue in her own. Earlier in the novel, Emma occupies herself
by envisaging Jane Fairfax’s supposed affair with Mr. Dixon, but
Jane’s reserve and Emma’s growing compassion for her have made this
line of speculation less worthwhile for Emma; now, for the first
time in the novel, Emma imagines herself as the heroine of her own
plot. Even so, her sentiments for Frank Churchill are no more real
than the feelings that she wrongly attributes to Mr. Elton, Jane,
and Mr. Knightley. Notably, her feelings for Frank flourish only
in his absence, which leaves Emma not unhappy but “busy and cheerful.” She
relishes the chance to envision her and Frank’s courtship, picturing
“a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment,
fancying interesting dialogues, and inventing elegant letters.”
She does not seem to relish the prospect of a courtship itself. 	Meanwhile, Mrs. Elton seems like a crude parody of the
earlier Emma, exhibiting Emma’s mistakes in an exaggerated form.
Mrs. Elton is constantly in search of young women to whom she can attach
herself and introduce into her society, and she holds matchmaking
an important goal. Emma immediately resents Mrs. Elton’s presumptuousness
in thinking she can make matches between strangers, and Mrs. Elton’s
blunt, outspoken nature makes us share Emma’s resentment. Still,
no great difference exists between Mrs. Elton’s behavior toward
Jane and Emma’s behavior toward Harriet, though Emma herself cannot
recognize the similarity. Both Emma and Mrs. Elton are guilty of
presumption. "
Chapters 22–24 ,"Summary: Chapter 22  In Highbury, there is great speculation about Miss Hawkins,
Mr. Elton’s fiancée. Mr. Elton returns to the village long enough
to confirm the rumors that his bride-to-be is beautiful, accomplished,
and of some fortune. Emma is relieved that his marriage will ease
the awkwardness of his return to their social circle, but she has
some uncharitable thoughts about Miss Hawkins’s inferior connections. She
has difficulty persuading Harriet to share her coolness, however. Only
the topic of Mr. Martin puts Mr. Elton out of Harriet’s mind. 	Harriet is flustered when Mr. Martin’s sister leaves
her a note at Mrs. Goddard’s. Emma decides that Harriet should return
the visit but stay only a brief time in order to reinforce the distance
that Emma, despite a twinge of conscience, believes Harriet must
maintain from the Martin family. Summary: Chapter 23  Emma takes Harriet to visit the Martins. Ahead of time,
they agree that Emma is to return and retrieve Harriet after fifteen
minutes. Harriet has a friendly and emotional visit with Mr. Martin’s
mother and sister, but when the visit is cut short, it is clear
the Martins understand that they have been slighted. Though pained,
Emma still believes she is doing what is best for Harriet. 	Emma’s spirits are revived by a meeting with Mr. and
Mrs. Weston, who bring the news that Frank Churchill’s arrival is
imminent. The following day, Emma unexpectedly meets Frank at Hartfield,
and she is pleased to find that he is very good-looking, bright, and
charming. Frank has just the right compliment for everyone, especially
Mrs. Weston, which pleases Emma. Emma can see that Mr. Weston hopes
that she and Frank might form an attachment, and she wonders if
the thought has occurred to Frank. When his father departs on an
errand, Frank leaves to call on his acquaintance from Weymouth,
Jane Fairfax. Summary: Chapter 24  Frank Churchill and Mrs. Weston visit Hartfield the next
day, and Emma is pleased by Frank’s warmth toward his stepmother.
He seems genuinely interested in everything about Highbury as the three
walk about the village, especially in the sites that are meaningful
to his father. Encountering an unused ballroom, he suggests that they
should organize a dance, and he dismisses Emma’s protestations about
the village’s lack of worthy families. 	Emma inquires about Frank’s visit with the Bateses, and
the two share impressions of Jane. Frank says that he finds her
unattractive and reserved. He thinks, however, that she is a talented
musician and affirms that they saw a good deal of each other in
Weymouth. Emma shares her theory about Jane and Mr. Dixon, which
Frank seems to resist, but then he gives in to Emma’s greater knowledge
of Jane. On the whole, Emma finds Frank even more to her liking
than she expected, possessing his father’s warmth and sociability
and lacking the proud airs one might acquire from the Churchills. "
Chapters 13–15 ,"Summary: Chapter 13  The Woodhouses and Knightleys are invited to the Westons’
for Christmas Eve dinner. Harriet and Mr. Elton are also included,
but Harriet comes down with a sore throat and is forced to miss
the gathering. Emma meets Mr. Elton while visiting Harriet and is pleased
by his attentions to her friend, but she remains puzzled that he
refuses her suggestion to skip the party since Harriet will not
be there. Mr. John Knightley witnesses the exchange and suggests
to Emma that Mr. Elton has feelings for her. Amused, Emma dismisses the
suggestion. When she and Mr. Elton travel to the gathering in the same
carriage, she is surprised that Mr. Elton’s concern for Harriet gives
way to cheerful anticipation of the evening ahead. Summary: Chapter 14  Entering the party, Emma attempts to put Mr. Elton’s strange
behavior out of her mind, but his constant hovering presence makes
her worry that Mr. John Knightley’s suggestion that Mr. Elton cares
for her may be correct. Meanwhile, Mr. Weston announces that Frank Churchill
is due to visit in early January. Emma feels some interest in this
news because she has half-seriously thought of Frank as a potential
suitor, though she does not anticipate giving up her vow to remain
single. Mrs. Weston confides to Emma that she has some anxiety about
meeting her stepson, and she fears Mrs. Churchill will prevent him
from coming. She and Emma speculate about the situation at Enscombe,
the Churchill estate, and Emma wonders why a young man should be
so dependent upon the impulses of his guardian. Summary: Chapter 15  Mr. Elton joins Emma in the drawing room and displeases
her by acting more concerned with her health than with Harriet’s.
John Knightley’s report that it has begun snowing leads to a small
crisis, and Mr. Woodhouse and Isabella are beside themselves with
worry about traveling the three-quarters of a mile home. Mr. Knightley assesses
the situation and reassures everyone that they will make it back
safely. 	In the confusion created by the party breaking up, Emma
finds herself alone in one of the carriages with Mr. Elton. He immediately declares
his love for her and proposes. Hoping that he is merely drunk, Emma
attempts to remind him that Harriet is the true object of his affections.
Astonished, Elton assures Emma that he has never been interested
in Harriet. Moreover, he is convinced that Emma has known of and
encouraged his sentiments. Emma sharply rebukes him and refuses
his proposal, and the two travel the remainder of the journey in
angry silence. Analysis: Chapters 13–15 Emma’s belief that she is different from others cannot
merely be attributed to her sense of superiority; it also results
from her ambition to make her life more interesting and more useful
than the limitations of village life seem to allow. Observing and
imagining the destinies of other lives exercises her intellect.
We might think of Emma as a kind of novelist creating plots for
the characters that people her world. In this sense, she may be
closer to Austen than her mistakes would lead us to believe. In
fact, Emma is somewhat prudish, afraid to consider marriage for
herself, despite her belief that “a good match” is the key to happiness
for her friends. Alert to what she believes are the subtleties of
flirtation between Harriet and Mr. Elton, she is incapable or unwilling
to see that she might be engaging in such social games herself. 	Emma’s confrontation with Mr. Elton is the novel’s first
major crisis. The true turning point is not Elton’s proposal, however,
but his accusation that Emma has known that she was the object of
his affections all along. He says, “I am sure you have seen and
understood me,” and for the first time in the novel Emma is at a
loss for words, fiercely angry. This is the first instance in which
Emma is implicated in the social interactions that she believed
she was manipulating from a position of control and detachment.
She has understood her own calculating behavior as beyond reproach,
in a sense invisible, and suddenly she is seen and placed within
the society from which she believed she has separated herself, forced
to realize that she has been lying to both Harriet and herself. "
Chapters 34–36 ,"Summary: Chapter 34  Fulfilling a social obligation, Emma plans a dinner party
for Mrs. Elton. Harriet asks to be excused from attending, which
gives Emma the opportunity to ease her conscience regarding Jane
Fairfax, who, at Harriet’s announced absence, is promptly invited
to fill the empty eighth seat. Mr. John Knightley is also included
because he will be in Highbury, accompanying his two eldest sons
on a visit to their aunt and grandfather. 	At the party, Mr. John Knightley gently reproaches Jane
for fetching letters from the post office that morning in the rain.
Jane acts as if the situation is not a big deal but ends up blushing
and watery-eyed, and soon the rest of the party begins discussing
the matter. Mrs. Elton insists that her servant should be given
the task of retrieving Jane’s letters, and Jane firmly resists.
The conversation moves to handwriting. Mr. Knightley praises Emma’s
penmanship but dissents when she praises the penmanship of Frank
Churchill. Jane’s eagerness to fetch her own letters rouses Emma’s
suspicions, but she decides not to trouble Jane by questioning her. Summary: Chapter 35  The women gather in the drawing room after dinner, and
Mrs. Elton pursues the subject of letter-retrieval with Jane. She
also insists on helping Jane find a governess position, though Jane
explains that she will not seek a place until after she sees the
Campbells in midsummer. The men come in, and Mr. Weston, who has
been on business in London, appears. He brings a letter from Frank,
reporting that Mrs. Churchill has decided that the household should
make an extended visit in London. This news means that Frank will
be able to be in Highbury a good deal. Mr. and Mrs. Weston are pleased, Emma
is somewhat agitated, and Mr. Knightley seems unexcited by the news. Summary: Chapter 36  Mr. Weston and Mrs. Elton have a long-winded conversation
in which they pursue comically different purposes. Mrs. Elton fishes for
compliments and goes on about Maple Grove, the estate where her
wealthy brother and sister-in-law live. Mr. Weston talks about Frank
and explains the illness of Frank’s aunt (and Mr. Weston’s sister-in-law),
Mrs. Churchill. Before the conversation becomes too heated, they
are interrupted by tea. Mr. John Knightley gives Emma final instructions
regarding his sons and wonders if they will be in the way at Hartfield,
now that Emma has become so social. She rejects John Knightley’s
implication and insists that she is more of a homebody than Mr.
(George) Knightley, who seems pleased and amused by the assertion. Analysis: Chapters 34–36 Austen’s use of three chapters to narrate a single dinner
party marks an interesting narrative development for English literature.
In novels by previous writers, the description of the events of
a dinner party would have taken up at most a page or two, but Austen
turns the dinner party into an opportunity to trace extensively
the ins and outs of human personality and interaction. In doing
so, she provides a model for later writers as disparate as Henry
James and Virginia Woolf. 	During the dinner party, we are given our first extended
view of Jane Fairfax, who begins to come out of her reserved shell
and speak more. Her well-crafted comments exemplify an ideal balance between
openness and propriety. For example, when Mr. John Knightley observes,
“When you have lived to my age, you will begin to think letters
are never worth going through the rain for,” Jane answers, “I must
not hope to be ever situated as you are, in the midst of every dearest
connection, and therefore I cannot expect that simply growing older
should make me indifferent about letters.” This answer is politely
vague but also expresses real emotion. It engages our pity, but
it tactfully avoids any suggestion of self-pity on Jane’s part.
Furthermore, when she firmly resists Mrs. Elton’s aggressive offers
of assistance, we realize that Jane’s quietness and reserve do not
indicate that she is dull or passive—she clearly has a mind of her own.
In fact, Jane is the character who voices the novel’s most explicit
social protest, which seems to come directly from Austen herself.
Jane speaks against the “governess-trade,” which involves “the sale,
not quite of human flesh, but of human intellect.” She admits that
offices that advertise for governess positions are less morally
deplorable than slave traders, but she adds, “[B]ut as to the greater
misery of the victims, I do not know where it lies.” "
Chapters 46–48 ,"Summary: Chapter 46  Mr. Weston arrives to escort Emma to see Mrs. Weston—clearly something
is amiss. Assured that Mrs. Weston is well, Emma’s first concern
is for Isabella’s family and for Mr. Knightley in London, but Mr.
Weston assures her that the news does not involve them. At Randalls,
Emma is greeted by Mrs. Weston, who explains that Frank has just
revealed that he and Jane have been secretly engaged. Emma is shocked,
embarrassed by the things she has said to Frank about Jane, and
concerned for Harriet’s feelings. 	Emma quickly relieves Mrs. Weston by assuring her that
she has no feelings for Frank. She is angry, however, about his
behavior toward her and Jane. Mrs. Weston defends her stepson, telling Emma
that there were misunderstandings between him and Jane and that
he will be writing her a letter detailing the extenuating circumstances.
Mr. Churchill has given his consent to the match, though he has
requested that it remain secret until more time has passed after
his wife’s death. Mr. Weston enters the room, and Emma assures him
that the news of Frank’s engagement has not caused her any pain. Summary: Chapter 47  
 	Emma is filled with concern for Harriet. She is angrier
at herself than she is at Frank, because she believes that she should
have discouraged Harriet’s attachment to him. Jane’s behavior since
her arrival in Highbury is also put into perspective. Emma realizes
that Jane has been avoiding her because she has seen her as a rival.
Emma dreads telling Harriet the news, but when Harriet arrives at
Hartfield she has already heard the story from Mr. Weston. Emma
is surprised at Harriet’s composure, and it turns out that Harriet
never cared for Frank; she has been harboring feelings for Mr. Knightley.
Harriet knows that Mr. Knightley is of higher rank than she, but
she affirms that Emma has given her hope that she may raise herself
enough to be acceptable to him. 	Emma makes a startling discovery—she herself is in love
with Mr. Knightley! She conceals her emotion from Harriet, asking
Harriet whether she has reason to believe that Knightley returns
her feelings. Harriet recounts a number of instances in which Knightley
has shown her special attention, many of which Emma’s memory corroborates.
When Harriet departs, Emma is left to reflect that she has been
wrong about everything, including her own heart. Now Knightley may
debase himself by marrying Harriet, and she has made it all possible. Summary: Chapter 48  Emma rethinks all of the events of the past months. She
realizes that it has always been important to her to be “first”
with Mr. Knightley and that he has always had special concern for
her, but she cannot believe he could return her feelings, especially
when he has just been so angry with her about her rudeness to Miss
Bates. She still believes she would not marry him, even if he asked,
because she cannot leave her father. She anticipates having the
opportunity to observe him and Harriet together. 	Mrs. Weston arrives to report that she has just visited
with Jane and that Jane admitted to having suffered a good deal
since entering into the secret engagement. She blames herself for
her misjudgment and acknowledges Emma’s kindness during her sickness.
Hearing this account, Emma again expresses anger at Frank’s behavior.
Mrs. Weston again defends him, though she has not yet received his explanatory
letter, but Emma is too distracted by her thoughts about Mr. Knightley
to pay attention. Emma regrets once more that she was not a better
friend to Jane, as Knightley had advised, and she reflects on how
desolate life will be without Knightley’s constant visits to Hartfield. "
Chapters 19–21 ,"Summary: Chapter 19  During a walk, Emma has little success turning Harriet’s
thoughts from Mr. Elton and therefore decides that they should call
on Mrs. and Miss Bates, a duty that Emma usually shuns. During their
visit, they are forced to hear about Mr. Elton and his travels,
and though Emma has tried to time her visit so as to avoid hearing
about Miss Bates’s niece, Jane Fairfax, Miss Bates produces a letter
from Jane, who lives with her guardians, Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.
The Campbells are about to visit their newly married daughter, Mrs. Dixon,
in Ireland, which means that Jane will be coming for an extended
visit in Highbury in a week’s time. Based on slight evidence, Emma
suspects that there has been a romance between Jane and the Campbells’
daughter’s husband, Mr. Dixon, and that this is the reason that
Jane is missing the trip to Ireland. Summary: Chapter 20  Jane’s history is given, starting from how, at age three,
she became an orphan after her father was killed in battle and her
mother died of consumption and grief. Jane lived with her aunt and
grandmother in Highbury until she was eight years old. Then, a friend
of her father’s, Colonel Campbell, took an interest in her well-being
and made her part of his household. He provided her with an education, but,
since he would be unable to give her an inheritance, it was understood
that when Jane came of age she would become a governess. Meanwhile,
Jane became dear to the Campbell family and enjoyed the pleasures
of elegant society in London. Her stay in Highbury constitutes her
last taste of freedom before becoming a governess. 	Jane arrives, and Emma greets the girl’s return after
two years’ absence with mixed feelings. She has never liked Jane,
for reasons she cannot fully explain (Mr. Knightley suggests to
her that she is jealous), but Jane’s beauty impresses her, and she
feels compassion for her impending fate. Soon the dullness of Jane’s
companions, along with Jane’s reserve, confirms Emma’s dislike.
Emma discovers that Jane has known Frank Churchill in Weymouth,
but Jane divulges little information about him. Summary: Chapter 21  Just as Mr. Knightley is about to give Emma some news,
the Bateses arrive with Jane to thank the Woodhouses for the hindquarter
of pork they have sent; they manage to precede Knightley in divulging that
Mr. Elton is to marry a Miss Hawkins. Emma is caught off guard,
and Mr. Knightley’s looks suggest he knows something of what has
transpired between them. However, she soon regains enough composure
to make another failed attempt to engage Jane in conversation. The
company departs, and Harriet bursts in with news that she has run
into Mr. Martin and his sister in town. She relates that after some
awkwardness, the pair greeted her with kindness, leaving Harriet
flustered. Emma is impressed by the Martins’ behavior and briefly
second-guesses her judgment of them, but she concludes that their
station in life is still too low for Harriet. She is only able to
distract Harriet from the episode by sharing the news of Mr. Elton’s
impending marriage. Analysis: Chapters 19–21 Miss Bates’s repetitious speeches, and the mileage she
can get from a single letter or piece of news from someone outside
of Highbury, strongly reinforce our sense of the claustrophobia
of village life. Though the character of Miss Bates is considered
a comic masterpiece, there is also a pathetic and even alarming
quality to the narrowness of her experience. In contrast to more
sophisticated and calculating characters such as Emma and Mr. Knightley,
who conceal or reveal what they are thinking depending upon the
appropriateness of the situation and the effect they wish to produce,
Miss Bates narrates everything that passes through her head, all
of it more or less harmless. 	With a more developed sense of Miss Bates’s character,
Austen provides some distinctly different views of women’s experience
in Highbury. She makes an implicit statement about intelligence
and its potential for creating hardship when she contrasts Emma
and Miss Bates. For instance, Miss Bates speaks in absurdly long,
digressive sentences, interrupting herself frequently and often
forgetting her point. In one example, she says: "
Chapters 37–39 ,"Summary: Chapter 37  Emma thinks about her agitation upon hearing of Frank’s
impending arrival and decides that she feels such apprehension more
on his behalf than her own—her attachment to him is not very strong. When
she sees him again, he is friendly and spirited but visits for only
fifteen minutes. Frank’s short visit convinces Emma that his feelings
as well must have weakened. Because of his aunt’s demands, Frank
is kept away for ten days after this first visit. Mrs. Churchill eventually
determines that her family must move from London to Richmond, which
places Frank closer to Highbury. Mr. Weston is delighted to have
his son nearer, and a date is set for the long-postponed ball. Summary: Chapter 38  The day of the ball arrives. Emma is invited by Mr. Weston
to come early and give her opinion on the arrangements, and she
believes that this opportunity will give some privacy to her second
meeting with Frank, who will be with his father. But Emma is not
the only one of Mr. Weston’s “favourites” that he has entreated
to come early, and all the while Frank seems excited but restless,
constantly moving to see who has arrived. Finally, when Jane and
Miss Bates arrive, Frank rushes out to help them with umbrellas.
Mrs. Elton pronounces Frank a very fine young man. Miss Bates overwhelms everyone
with exclamations of gratitude and pleasure. Frank tells Emma that
he dislikes Mrs. Elton and her familiar manner with Jane, and he
runs off again to ask his father when the dancing will begin. 	Mr. and Mrs. Weston suddenly realize that Mrs. Elton
expects to be asked to lead the dance and that they cannot give
Emma that honor, as they had hoped. Despite this slight disappointment,
Emma enjoys the beginning of the festivities, though she is disturbed
that Mr. Knightley will not dance. She admires the figure he cuts
among the other men, and he notices that he is watching her. The
ball is a success, and only one episode mars Emma’s enjoyment. During
one dance, Harriet is left without a partner, and Mr. Elton, the
one dancer who is disengaged, pointedly refuses to ask her. Mr.
Knightley soothes Harriet’s embarrassment by asking her to dance,
and Emma is very pleased with him. Later, she expresses her gratitude, and
he asks her why the Eltons are her enemies. She admits that she wanted
Mr. Elton to marry Harriet and acknowledges that Knightley was right
about his character. Knightley in return admits that Harriet has
more admirable qualities than he originally thought. Emma and Knightley
cement their new mutual understanding with a dance. Summary: Chapter 39  Emma looks back on her talk with Mr. Knightley at the
ball with pleasure, and she rejoices that the Eltons’ rudeness has
cured Harriet of her infatuation with Mr. Elton. Suddenly, Frank
appears with Harriet, fainting, on his arm. When revived, Harriet
tells the story of how she was walking with a friend, Miss Bickerton,
when a Gypsy child approached to beg from them. Miss Bickerton,
frightened, ran away, but Harriet was unable to follow because of
a cramp she had gotten at the ball. Just as she started to panic,
a group of Gypsies surrounded her and demanded money. Frank happened
to be walking along and frightened the Gypsies away. Emma cannot
help but wonder whether this romantic circumstance might make Harriet
and Frank interesting to each other. The episode alarms Mr. Woodhouse and
is occasion for gossip, but the Gypsies leave the neighborhood and
no harm is done. Analysis: Chapters 37–39 Emma’s honest reflections about her lack of substantive
feelings for Frank reveal her growing maturity. She no longer sees
him as a character in the scenes she imagines for herself, someone
who is important simply because he gives her the opportunity to
show off her accomplishments and elegance. She recognizes that if
their two-month separation has not cooled his love, “there were
dangers and evils before her: caution for him and for herself would
be necessary.” Rather than anticipating a dramatic scene, she now
hopes that “she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration. That
would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance.”
Emma’s decision to observe Frank to see how he feels, rather than
to begin with an assumption about how he feels, enables her to understand
that Frank is not in love with her. The narrator makes clear that
Emma’s vanity is not at issue in this case—she is relieved, not
offended, that Frank’s feelings are cooled, and at the dance, she seems
to find more interest in puzzling about his odd mood than in courting
his attention. When Frank and Emma dance, instead of imagining how
elegant they look to others, she admires how elegant Mr. Knightley
looks. Emma has become more concerned with observing others, and
less concerned with being observed by others. 	The Gypsies Harriet describes encountering in Chapter  "
Chapters 40–42 ,"Summary: Chapter 40  Harriet comes to tell Emma that her infatuation with Mr.
Elton has passed and to relinquish the trinkets she has kept to
remember him by. First, she shows Emma a bit of court-plaster (used
at the time as a bandage) that she had lent to Mr. Elton when he
cut himself. He had used what he needed but discarded the rest,
which Harriet then kept. Emma feels guilty in recalling that she
had lied and said that she did not have any court-plaster, so that
Harriet would have the opportunity to be Elton’s healer. Harriet’s
second trinket is a useless bit of pencil Elton had discarded. She
throws both items into the fire, and Emma hopes that Frank might
take Elton’s place. Her hopes seem to be rewarded when, during another
conversation, Harriet says she will never marry, inciting Emma’s
suspicion that Harriet does not think that she will marry because
she is interested in someone of a higher class. After some hesitation,
Emma asks if Harriet has feelings for someone of higher rank. Harriet
says yes, and Emma comments that she is not surprised, given the
service that this person rendered Harriet. Emma says that they must
not discuss it anymore, and she advises Harriet to be cautious but
not to give up all hope. Summary: Chapter 41  Mr. Knightley begins to suspect that there is some secret
understanding between Frank and Jane. During a walk with Emma, Harriet,
Mr. and Mrs. Weston, Frank, Jane, and Miss Bates, Knightley witnesses
a strange exchange. Frank asks Mrs. Weston if anything has come
of Mr. Perry’s plan to buy a carriage. She has no idea what he is
talking about, and he swears that she wrote of it in a letter to him
some months ago. She denies it, and Frank decides he must have dreamed
it. Miss Bates remembers that there was talk of the Perrys getting
a carriage at her house (with Jane present) but that it was a secret.
Mr. Knightley observes Frank trying to catch Jane’s eye after this. 	The party reaches Hartfield, and Emma persuades everyone
to come in for tea. A word game ensues, which Mr. Knightley watches. Frank
constructs the word “blunder” using alphabet tiles, which he shows
to Jane. Then he constructs the word “Dixon,” shows it to Emma,
who laughs, and then shows it to Jane, who pushes the puzzle away
in anger. When the party breaks up, Knightley stays behind to speak
to Emma—he knows that everyone considers her the object of Frank’s
affection, and he wishes to warn her. Knightley asks Emma about
the “Dixon” joke, and, embarrassed, she refuses to explain. He tells
her his suspicion about Jane and Frank, and she laughs at him, stating
unequivocally that she can answer for Frank’s indifference to Jane.
Knightley is silenced and irritated by Emma’s implication that she
is in Frank’s confidence. Summary: Chapter 42  An outing to Box Hill is planned, but it has to be postponed
because of a lame horse. Mr. Knightley half-jokingly suggests that
the party come to his estate instead. Mrs. Elton seizes upon the
idea, and Knightley has to be firm to prevent her from planning
all the details. Meanwhile, the lame horse heals, and it is decided
that the Box Hill party will follow the one at Donwell Abbey, Knightley’s
estate. At Donwell Abbey, Emma enjoys examining Knightley’s house
and grounds. She overhears Jane resisting a governess “situation”
that Mrs. Elton has found for her. Walking through the garden, Emma finds
Harriet and Knightley looking out over the Martin family home and
thinks the two an odd grouping, but is nevertheless convinced that
Harriet is in good hands. Mrs. Weston is worried by the fact that
Frank is late coming from Richmond. At the house, Emma encounters
an agitated Jane, who asks her to tell everyone else that she has
walked home. Frank then turns up out of humor and in the course
of conversation says that he would like to go abroad. Emma teases
him out of his mood, and he promises to join the Box Hill trip. Analysis: Chapters 40–42 Even though Emma has resolved to use more discretion in
promoting a match between Harriet and Frank than she used when encouraging
Harriet’s affection for Mr. Elton, she manages to cause a misunderstanding
precisely because she shies away from explicit statements. When
Emma says of Harriet’s new object of affection, “The service he
rendered you was enough to warm your heart,” she is referring to
Frank, who saved Harriet from the Gypsies. Harriet, however, thinks
of Mr. Knightley, who saved her from humiliation by asking her to
dance. 	In the way it keeps us in the dark about the truth of
various characters’ feelings,  "
Chapters 49–51 ,"Summary: Chapter 49  
 	Emma goes for a walk in the garden. To her surprise,
Mr. Knightley joins her. He has just returned from London. She worries
that Knightley will confess his feelings for Harriet, and she offers
her news about Frank and Jane’s secret engagement. Knightley already knows
about it and offers his consolation, but Emma assures him she has
never had feelings for Frank. She explains and expresses regret
for her behavior, and Knightley is strangely silent. Finally, he admits
he may have underrated Frank and expresses envy at his circumstances.
Worried that Knightley is about to discuss Harriet, Emma quickly
silences him. He is mortified, and seeing his pain Emma invites
him to speak after all, saying she will be glad to hear him as a
friend. He says he does not wish her friendship and declares his
love. She is surprised, thrilled, and by the time they reach the house
they are engaged to marry. Knightley is surprised as well—he was
convinced that Emma was in love with Frank; he departed for London
to cool his feelings for her, and he has returned thinking she would
need comfort. He has moved from resigned despair to perfect happiness
in half an hour. Summary: Chapter 50  Emma can barely conceal her feelings as she and Mr. Knightley
join her father for tea. That night, Emma lies awake worrying about Harriet
and her father. She decides she will write a letter to Harriet explaining
what has happened and arrange for Harriet to visit Isabella in London
to give both of them some time to adjust to the new situation. She
decides that she and Knightley must postpone their wedding until
after her father dies. 	Mrs. Weston forwards Emma a letter from Frank in which
he explains that all of his actions, including his attentions to
Emma, were guided by a need to maintain the secrecy of his engagement
to Jane. He apologizes for his behavior, but explains that he could
tell Emma was not attached to him, and says that he was under the impression
that Emma already knew about him and Jane. He adores Jane and is
miserable that he has made her suffer. The couple quarreled the
morning of the Donwell Abbey party because Jane was upset about
his behavior toward Emma, thinking it an inappropriate way to maintain
their secret. Frank was upset about Jane’s caution, which he interpreted
as coldness. Frank then left for Richmond, and Jane wrote to him
to break off the engagement. He received the letter from Jane the
morning his aunt died, and in the flurry of subsequent correspondence
failed to send his conciliating response to her. She sent his letters
back to him, indicating that he could return her letters at her
governess post. This was the first news Frank had heard of her new
position, and he threw himself at his uncle’s mercy, receiving approval
for the match. He then sped to Highbury to find Jane very ill. They
reconciled, and Frank admits that he is happier than he deserves
to be. Summary: Chapter 51  Emma, in her own happiness, cannot help but forgive Frank.
When Knightley comes to her, she shares the letter with him. He
reads the letter, telling Emma his impressions as he goes along,
and he is less softened than she but willing to admit that Frank
has some good qualities. He and Emma discuss her father, and he
agrees that Emma cannot leave Hartfield and that Mr. Woodhouse cannot
be expected to move to Donwell Abbey. He suggests that he move to
Hartfield, and Emma is moved by his sacrifice. She promises to think
it over, and soon likes the plan—her only sadness is that this engagement and
relocation will estrange her and Harriet further. Analysis: Chapters 49–51 Nearly every sentence that passes between Emma and Knightley

Chapters 43–45 ,"Summary: Chapter 43  
 The Box Hill trip is not a success. Mr. and Mrs. Elton
keep to themselves; Mr. Knightley, Miss Bates, and Jane form a second
exclusive party; and Emma stays with Harriet and Frank. Emma is
disappointed by Harriet’s and Frank’s dullness. Later, Frank becomes excessively
lively and gallant. Emma is confident that there is nothing behind
his flirtations, but she is aware that others can pick up on their
flirtation. The party sits about listlessly, and Frank says that Emma
demands to know what they are thinking of. Mrs. Elton is offended
by Frank’s deference to Emma, and Knightley asks dryly if she would  	Frank comments that sometimes matches made in public
places become regrettable on further acquaintance and that, as a
result, Mr. and Mrs. Elton are lucky that they are compatible. Jane
demurs and leaves for a walk with her aunt and Mr. Knightley. Emma,
left with Frank, grows tired of his flattery. Later, Mr. Knightley
takes Emma aside and reprimands her for her conduct toward Miss
Bates, reminding Emma that Miss Bates has had an unfortunate life
and deserves compassion. Emma has never felt “so agitated, so mortified,
[so] grieved” in her life; she cries almost all the way home. Summary: Chapter 44  On reflection, Emma decides that the Box Hill party was
a disaster. Still feeling horrible about her treatment of Miss Bates,
Emma soothes her conscience by visiting the Bateses first thing
the following morning. Miss Bates’s humility and kindness are a
further reproach to Emma’s bad behavior. During Emma’s visit, Jane remains
in the bedroom with a headache. 	Jane has just accepted the governess position recommended
by Mrs. Elton, and Emma expresses surprise and genuine concern for the
unhappiness Jane’s departure must cause everyone. Jane will leave
within a fortnight (two weeks). Emma is surprised to learn that
Frank departed the previous evening for Richmond, and she is struck
by the difference between Mrs. Churchill’s power and Jane’s. She
is ashamed of her earlier conjectures about Jane’s relationship with
Mr. Dixon. Summary: Chapter 45  Emma returns to Hartfield to discover that Mr. Knightley
and Harriet have arrived in her absence. Knightley is about to depart
for London to visit John and Isabella. His hastiness surprises Emma. Mr.
Woodhouse inquires about Emma’s visit with the Bateses, and Emma
blushes and exchanges a glance with Knightley. She believes he understands
her feelings and forgives her. He makes an unusual gesture, taking
her hand and almost kissing it. She is gratified, though a little
puzzled about his scruple in completing the kiss. 	The next day, unexpected news arrives: Mrs. Churchill
has died. Emma thinks this event may improve Harriet’s chances with
Frank. Meanwhile, she attempts to provide assistance to Jane, inviting
her to Hartfield, sending her healthful foods, and attempting to
visit her. Jane pleads ill health, but Emma hears that Jane has
been taking outside exercise, and she feels hurt that Jane seems
to be particularly avoiding her. "
Chapters 52–55 ,"Summary: Chapter 52  Harriet agrees to Emma’s plan to send her to London on
the pretense that she needs to see a dentist, which satisfies Emma
since she does not want to hurt Harriet with news of Emma and Mr.
Knightley’s engagement. Emma decides not to tell her father of her
engagement until Mrs. Weston, who is pregnant, has given birth to
her baby. Meanwhile, she pays a visit to Jane. They are unable to
speak openly because Mrs. Elton is there, and Jane’s engagement
is still supposed to be a secret. However, Emma interprets some
of Mrs. Elton’s remarks and expressions as ostentatious indications
that Mrs. Elton is in on the secret of Jane and Frank’s engagement. 	Mr. Elton turns up, annoyed that Mr. Knightley has missed
a meeting with him. Emma decides he must be waiting for her at Hartfield
and leaves. When Jane walks her out, they are reconciled, each feeling
that she owes the other an apology, both full of goodwill. Summary: Chapter 53  Mrs. Weston safely delivers a baby girl, much to Emma’s
delight. Mr. Knightley reminisces about how headstrong Emma was
when she was a child. She expresses gratitude that he so often corrected her
mistakes, and he asserts that she would have done just as well without
him. Emma is grieved that she cannot speak more openly with him
about Harriet. Mr. John Knightley congratulates Mr. Knightley and
Emma on their engagement, and shocks the couple by saying that he
is not surprised by their news. 	Emma works up the courage to give her father the news.
Mr. Woodhouse is shocked, but he gradually begins to resign himself
to it. Mrs. Weston helps persuade him that his happiness will be increased
rather than diminished. She is surprised and overwhelmingly pleased
by the match. Mr. Weston shares the news with Jane and Miss Bates,
and soon Emma and Knightley’s engagement is the talk of Highbury.
Only the Eltons are displeased that Emma has made such a good match. Summary: Chapter 54  Mr. Knightley has news for Emma: Harriet is to marry Robert
Martin. Knightley had sent Mr. Martin to London with a package for
his brother while Harriet was there, and Mr. Martin began to spend time
with the family. Knightley worries that Emma is upset, but in fact
she is thrilled, amazed, and amused at Harriet’s rapid recovery. Emma
is thankful that she has not done Harriet greater injury, and she
is glad that soon she will no longer need to conceal Harriet’s emotional
state from Knightley. 	Emma and Mr. Knightley go to visit Randalls and find
Frank and Jane there. At first, Emma’s meeting with Frank is awkward,
but soon they are back on easy terms, joking about all that has
passed. Frank’s ability to speak lightly of all he and Jane have
suffered is not entirely approved by his fiancée, and Emma feels
Knightley’s superiority to Frank. "

Chapters 1–3 ,"Summary: Chapter 1  
 	The narrator opens the novel by introducing us to Emma
Woodhouse, a girl endowed with “some of the best blessings of existence,”
including good looks, intelligence, riches, and an affectionate father.
Emma’s only disadvantages are that she is slightly spoiled and that
she thinks “a little too well of herself.” Emma’s mother died before
Emma could form many memories of her, but her gentle governess,
Miss Taylor, provided a motherly love. After Emma’s older sister,
Isabella, was married and moved to London, Miss Taylor and Emma
became best friends. 	As the novel begins, Miss Taylor has just left Hartfield,
the estate of Emma and Mr. Woodhouse, to marry a widower named Mr. Weston,
and Emma is left without a companion. She attempts to comfort her
despondent father, who hates change, with the thought that they
will see the new Mrs. Weston often, but Emma only partially succeeds
in comforting herself. At this moment, neighborhood resident Mr.
Knightley, the brother of Isabella’s husband, pays a visit, having
returned from visiting their mutual relations in London. He affirms
the appropriateness of the match between Mr. Weston and Miss Taylor
and gently chides Emma when she claims credit. Emma declares that
she will repeat her matchmaking success by finding a wife for Mr.
Elton, the village rector. Summary: Chapter 2  The narrator recounts Mr. Weston’s history. His first
marriage was to a woman named Miss Churchill, who came from a higher
class than his. They had a son, named Frank, but the marriage was
overshadowed by the disapproval of Mrs. Weston’s brother and sister-in-law,
Mr. and Mrs. Churchill. When Mrs. Weston died after three years
of marriage, Frank was essentially adopted by Mr. and Mrs. Churchill
and made their heir. Mr. Weston, left impoverished by the expectations
of his first wife, spent the next twenty years of his life rebuilding
his fortune. He eventually purchased Randalls, the small estate
where he lives with the second Mrs. Weston. 	The village has always been curious to see Frank Churchill,
who writes a kind letter to Mrs. Weston indicating that he will
pay a visit to his father and stepmother. Summary: Chapter 3  The Woodhouses give a small dinner party, to which they
invite other members of their social circle: the widow Mrs. Bates;
her single, middle-aged daughter, Miss Bates; and Mrs. Goddard,
the mistress of the local boarding school. Mrs. Goddard brings one
of her boarders, Harriet Smith, a girl whose parentage is unknown.
Emma admires Harriet for her beauty and for her respect of Emma
and Hartfield. She resolves to pursue friendship with Harriet, and
to improve the naïve girl by detaching her from the inferior acquaintance
of the farming Martin family. She plans to introduce Harriet to
higher society. Analysis: Chapters 1–3 The narration of these opening chapters creates a complicated
portrait of Emma as a young, beautiful, clever, and confident character who
exercises her influence in a constricted and complex environment
and has much to learn about friendship, love, and the ways of the
world. Emma’s affection for Miss Taylor and her kindness to her foolish
and somewhat tiresome father reveal Emma’s capacity for true warmth
and generosity. But, at the same time, the narrator quickly alerts
us to the ways in which Emma is spoiled by her advantages and blinded
by her own self-regard. Most explicitly, we are told at the novel’s
beginning: "
Chapters 25–27 ,"Summary: Chapter 25  Emma’s good opinion of Frank Churchill is injured when
he makes a day trip to London just to have his hair cut. Though
Emma does not feel inclined to give up her vow to remain single,
she decides that Frank is pleasing enough that she does not mind
being associated with him in other people’s minds. Mr. Knightley
thinks Frank is a silly young man, just as he had suspected. 	Meanwhile, an invitation from the Coles, successful tradespeople
who live in Highbury, creates a conundrum for Emma. She had originally
decided that she would not accept an invitation from the nouveau-riche
family, but when everyone except the Woodhouses receives an invitation
to a dinner party at the Coles’ home, Emma feels left out. When
an invitation arrives, she decides to accept it. Summary: Chapter 26  Emma arrives at the Coles’ party behind Mr. Knightley.
Because Knightley usually walks, Emma is surprised that he has come
in his carriage. At dinner, it is revealed that Jane Fairfax has
received the mysterious gift of a pianoforte. People assume the
piano is from Colonel Campbell, but Emma tells Frank she suspects
that it is a gift from Mr. Dixon. When Jane arrives later, she blushes
when questioned about the piano. 	Meanwhile, Mrs. Weston tells Emma that Mr. Knightley
brought his carriage so that he could convey Jane home. Mrs. Weston
suggests that a match may be forming between Jane and Mr. Knightley, but
Emma resists this supposition vigorously, explaining that she cannot
bear the thought of Mr. Knightley marrying because then her nephew,
George and Isabella’s son Henry, will not be able to inherit Donwell
Abbey, the Knightley estate in the town of the same name. Mrs. Weston
suspects that Mr. Knightley is the one who sent Jane the pianoforte. 	Emma and Jane sing and play the piano for the company,
with Frank accompanying. When Frank persuades Jane to sing one more song
after her voice has begun to grow hoarse, Mr. Knightley intervenes.
Emma questions Mr. Knightley about the carriage and pianoforte.
His answers convince her that he did not send the gift, but do not
enable her to decide if he has feelings for Jane. When impromptu dancing
begins, she is relieved that he does not ask Jane to dance. Emma
is also pleased that Frank immediately asks her and not Jane for
a dance. There is time for only two dances, however, before the party
breaks up. Frank comments to Emma that he is lucky the dancing had
to end; otherwise he would have found himself asking Jane Fairfax
for a dance. Summary: Chapter 27  Emma is thoroughly pleased with her evening at the Coles,
but she is uncertain about the appropriateness of telling Frank
about her suspicions about Jane or acknowledging the superiority
of Jane’s musical abilities. At the Coles’ party, Harriet heard
that Mr. Martin had dined with the Cox family, and there is a rumor
that a Cox daughter would like to marry Mr. Martin. To distract
and protect Harriet, Emma accompanies her on a shopping trip. They
then decide to pay a visit to the Bates household and run into Frank
and Mrs. Weston on their way. The visit seems to have been Frank’s
idea, but he offers to stay with Emma and send Mrs. Weston to make
the visit on her own. Emma sends him along, knowing that he will
later come see her at Hartfield, but Miss Bates then comes into
the shop to ask Emma to come give her opinion of Jane’s new pianoforte.
In her rambling, Miss Bates reveals that Mr. Knightley has sent
his last apples of the season to Jane, who is particularly fond
of them. "
Chapters 28–30 ,"Summary: Chapter 28  Emma enters the Bates’ sitting room and finds Frank occupied
with fixing Mrs. Bates’s glasses and Jane seated at the piano. Frank
asks Jane questions about how she imagines the piano came to her,
and his comment, “True affection only could have prompted it,” makes Jane
blush. Believing that Frank is teasing Jane unkindly about Mr. Dixon,
Emma whispers that he should stop, and she regrets having shared
her speculations about Jane with him. Mr. Knightley stops by to
check on Jane’s health but refuses to come in when he hears that Frank
is there. Summary: Chapter 29  While the Woodhouses are visiting Randalls, Frank and
Emma work on planning a ball so they can finish the dancing inaugurated at
the Coles’. They decide the room at Randalls is too small. Mr. Woodhouse
privately tells Mrs. Weston his concern that Frank is so thoughtless
about opening and shutting doors that he exposes Emma, Harriet,
and Mrs. Weston to dangerous drafts. The next solution proposed
by Frank on behalf of Mr. Weston is that the ball be given at the
Crown Inn. Though Frank does a poor job reassuring Mr. Woodhouse
that this plan will not give them all colds, Emma comforts her father,
and she agrees to the plan. There are further practical difficulties,
and Frank proposes he go fetch Miss Bates along with her niece,
whom Frank admits he does not immediately recollect, for advice.
By the time he returns, the difficulties have been resolved, the
date of the ball has been set, and Frank secures from Emma a promise
to dance the first two dances with him. Summary: Chapter 30  Emma is worried that Frank’s aunt, Mrs. Churchill, will
refuse Frank permission to stay on for the ball, which is scheduled
for a few days after his visit is scheduled to end. To everyone’s
relief, he receives this permission. Only Mr. Knightley refuses
to look forward to the ball: he does not seem interested in dancing.
Emma takes Knightley’s diffidence as further proof that he is not
interested in Jane, who in a rare moment of openness confesses how
much she looks forward to the ball. 	Two days later, Frank is called back to Enscombe because
his aunt is ill. The ball is postponed indefinitely, and Frank comes
to Emma to say goodbye. He is clearly dejected and speaks haltingly—for
a moment, it seems as if he is going to declare something serious. Interrupted
by his father, Frank departs, and Emma is depressed. Highbury society
is, it seems for Emma, severely diminished without Frank’s charms.
Emma concludes that she must be “a little in love” with Frank after
all. Analysis: Chapters 28–30 During Emma and Frank’s visit to the Bates’, Emma, Frank,
and Jane are all aware that the dialogue taking place has a subtext,
but Austen crafts Frank’s words so that the subtexts Emma and Jane read
differ from one another. At this point in the novel, our misperceptions
are likely to closely match Emma’s, and we follow her in believing
that Frank’s teasing of Jane about the origins of her piano cruelly
refers to Mr. Dixon. Though Emma gossips maliciously about Jane, her selfless
protectiveness of Jane when she believes Frank to be teasing her
shows that Emma’s willingness to amuse herself at the expense of
another has limits. When we later learn that the piano is actually
a gift from Frank, Jane’s secret fiancé, we realize that his teasing
is more good-natured, emphasizing his own gesture of affection. "
Chapters 4–6 ,"Summary: Chapter 4  Emma and Harriet strike up an immediate intimacy as Harriet replaces
Mrs. Weston as Emma’s companion on her habitual walks. Emma remains
unimpressed with Harriet’s intelligence but appreciates her willingness
to be guided. Emma encourages Harriet to tell everything about herself,
and their conversation soon centers on the Martin family, which
Harriet has visited frequently over the past two months. Emma is
alarmed to learn that the family includes an eligible bachelor,
Mr. Robert Martin, and fears that her friend may have feelings for
him. A match between Harriet and Mr. Martin would be unacceptable
to Emma because the Martins are farmers, and therefore, in her opinion,
socially beneath her new friend. She discourages Harriet from thinking
well of Mr. Martin by asking questions about his education and predicting
that any wife Mr. Martin takes will be too inferior to merit friendship
with Harriet. After they run into Mr. Martin on one of their walks,
Emma encourages Harriet to compare his manners with those of the
gentlemen they know, praising Mr. Elton’s manners as particularly
genteel. The narrator reveals that Emma determined during the party
at Hartfield to encourage a match between Harriet and Mr. Elton. Summary: Chapter 5  Mr. Knightley and Mrs. Weston converse about Emma’s new
friendship with Harriet. Knightley believes that the friendship
is dangerous for both parties. Harriet’s flattery, Knightley suspects,
will reinforce Emma’s self-regard, while Emma’s influence will injure Harriet’s
happiness, because Harriet “will grow just refined enough to be
uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstance have
placed her home.” Mrs. Weston disagrees, believing that Emma needs
Harriet’s companionship and that Emma’s company will improve Harriet.
She advises Knightley to keep his mouth shut, and the conversation
ends with speculation about what will become of Emma. Noting Emma’s
declaration that she will never marry and her lack of suitable prospects,
Knightley comments that he “should like to see Emma in love, and
in some doubt of a return; it would do her good.” Summary: Chapter 6  Emma continues to point out Mr. Elton’s finer qualities
to Harriet and is convinced that he is already in love with her
friend. Mr. Elton praises the graces that Harriet has gained in
Emma’s company, and he quickly seconds Emma’s idea to paint a watercolor
portrait of Harriet. As Emma paints, Mr. Elton is only too attentive
to her progress, and though Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley point
out that Emma has exaggerated Harriet’s beauty, Mr. Elton emphatically praises
the portrait’s likeness. He volunteers to take the watercolor to
London to be framed. All the while, Emma continues to believe that
Mr. Elton’s enthusiasm is for Harriet, though Mr. Elton makes comments
on Emma’s skill in rendering and improving on the beautiful subject. Analysis: Chapters 4–6 Over the course of these three chapters, we learn that
Emma is extremely class-conscious and also somewhat manipulative.
She unattractively dismisses Robert Martin because of his social
class, saying, “The yeomanry [the class of farmers who hold land
under long- term leases] are precisely the order of people with
whom I feel I can have nothing to do. A degree or two lower, and
a creditable appearance might interest me; I might hope to be useful
to their families in some way or another.” In other words, Emma
is only interested in people who are of her social class or so far
beneath her that she might, from a comfortable position of superiority,
flatter herself by being “useful” to them. Such superior usefulness
is what Emma attempts with Harriet, and she even lies to her friend
in order to manipulate her. Although Emma observes to herself that
Mr. Martin’s “appearance was very neat and he looked like a sensible
young man,” she tells Harriet, “He is very plain … remarkably plain,
but that is nothing compared to his entire want of gentility.” 	Mr. Knightley and Mrs. Weston make Emma seem more likable than
she makes herself seem. Because Knightley shows himself to have
good sense, and also because he is the one character willing to find
fault with Emma, he is the novel’s most reliable mouthpiece for Austen’s
views of Emma. His discussion of Emma shows that he genuinely cares
for her but views her as a child lacking sense and understanding
rather than as an equal. He believes that Emma has been “spoiled
by being the cleverest of her family” but respects her stubbornness
and independence. He also admits that though Emma is very pretty,
she is not vain about her looks; “her vanity lies another way.”
Knightley’s pointed criticisms are offset by Mrs. Weston’s dismissive
remarks that Emma is a caring daughter, sister, and friend who “will
make no lasting blunder.” 	Like Austen’s narration, the dialogue between characters
frequently contains a subtext available only to certain characters
or to the reader. For instance, when Emma says to Harriet, “I wish
you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, when ever [Mr. Martin] does marry—I
mean as to being acquainted with his wife … it does not follow that
he might marry anybody at all fit for you to notice,” we admire
the cleverness of Emma’s suggestion to Harriet that Mr. Martin is
beneath her, even as we disapprove of Emma’s action. Chapter  "
Chapters 19–21 ,"Summary: Chapter 19  During a walk, Emma has little success turning Harriet’s
thoughts from Mr. Elton and therefore decides that they should call
on Mrs. and Miss Bates, a duty that Emma usually shuns. During their
visit, they are forced to hear about Mr. Elton and his travels,
and though Emma has tried to time her visit so as to avoid hearing
about Miss Bates’s niece, Jane Fairfax, Miss Bates produces a letter
from Jane, who lives with her guardians, Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.
The Campbells are about to visit their newly married daughter, Mrs. Dixon,
in Ireland, which means that Jane will be coming for an extended
visit in Highbury in a week’s time. Based on slight evidence, Emma
suspects that there has been a romance between Jane and the Campbells’
daughter’s husband, Mr. Dixon, and that this is the reason that
Jane is missing the trip to Ireland. Summary: Chapter 20  Jane’s history is given, starting from how, at age three,
she became an orphan after her father was killed in battle and her
mother died of consumption and grief. Jane lived with her aunt and
grandmother in Highbury until she was eight years old. Then, a friend
of her father’s, Colonel Campbell, took an interest in her well-being
and made her part of his household. He provided her with an education, but,
since he would be unable to give her an inheritance, it was understood
that when Jane came of age she would become a governess. Meanwhile,
Jane became dear to the Campbell family and enjoyed the pleasures
of elegant society in London. Her stay in Highbury constitutes her
last taste of freedom before becoming a governess. 	Jane arrives, and Emma greets the girl’s return after
two years’ absence with mixed feelings. She has never liked Jane,
for reasons she cannot fully explain (Mr. Knightley suggests to
her that she is jealous), but Jane’s beauty impresses her, and she
feels compassion for her impending fate. Soon the dullness of Jane’s
companions, along with Jane’s reserve, confirms Emma’s dislike.
Emma discovers that Jane has known Frank Churchill in Weymouth,
but Jane divulges little information about him. Summary: Chapter 21  Just as Mr. Knightley is about to give Emma some news,
the Bateses arrive with Jane to thank the Woodhouses for the hindquarter
of pork they have sent; they manage to precede Knightley in divulging that
Mr. Elton is to marry a Miss Hawkins. Emma is caught off guard,
and Mr. Knightley’s looks suggest he knows something of what has
transpired between them. However, she soon regains enough composure
to make another failed attempt to engage Jane in conversation. The
company departs, and Harriet bursts in with news that she has run
into Mr. Martin and his sister in town. She relates that after some
awkwardness, the pair greeted her with kindness, leaving Harriet
flustered. Emma is impressed by the Martins’ behavior and briefly
second-guesses her judgment of them, but she concludes that their
station in life is still too low for Harriet. She is only able to
distract Harriet from the episode by sharing the news of Mr. Elton’s
impending marriage. Analysis: Chapters 19–21 Miss Bates’s repetitious speeches, and the mileage she
can get from a single letter or piece of news from someone outside
of Highbury, strongly reinforce our sense of the claustrophobia
of village life. Though the character of Miss Bates is considered
a comic masterpiece, there is also a pathetic and even alarming
quality to the narrowness of her experience. In contrast to more
sophisticated and calculating characters such as Emma and Mr. Knightley,
who conceal or reveal what they are thinking depending upon the
appropriateness of the situation and the effect they wish to produce,
Miss Bates narrates everything that passes through her head, all
of it more or less harmless. 	With a more developed sense of Miss Bates’s character,
Austen provides some distinctly different views of women’s experience
in Highbury. She makes an implicit statement about intelligence
and its potential for creating hardship when she contrasts Emma
and Miss Bates. For instance, Miss Bates speaks in absurdly long,
digressive sentences, interrupting herself frequently and often
forgetting her point. In one example, she says: "
Chapters 7–9 ,"Summary: Chapter 7  Harriet receives a letter from Mr. Martin proposing marriage
and goes directly to Emma to seek advice. Emma acts as if there
is obviously no doubt that Harriet should not accept, and she proceeds
to offer Harriet advice about the wording of her refusal. When it becomes
clear that Harriet is doubtful about her answer, Emma becomes somewhat
cold and disingenuously states, “I shall not give you any advice,
Harriet. . . . This is a point which you must settle with your own
feelings.” When, under Emma’s subtle guidance, Harriet states that
she will probably reject Mr. Martin, Emma immediately congratulates
her friend on having made the right decision and points out that
if Harriet had accepted him, then Emma would no longer be able to
be her friend. Harriet immediately affirms that the loss of Emma
is unthinkable, and the two of them draft a letter refusing the
proposal. It is clear that Harriet is pained by her decision and
cares for Mr. Martin, but Emma cheers her up with reminders of Mr.
Elton. Summary: Chapter 8  With Harriet at Mrs. Goddard’s preparing for an extended
visit to Hartfield, Mr. Knightley and Emma have the opportunity
for a lengthy conversation about Harriet and Mr. Martin. Knightley reveals
that Mr. Martin has consulted him about proposing to Harriet, and
Mr. Knightley makes it clear that he supports the match. Emma informs
him that the proposal has already been made and rejected, and she
insists that Mr. Martin is not Harriet’s equal. Knightley very nearly
loses his temper, and he insists upon Mr. Martin’s superiority to
Harriet in sense and “true gentility.” Knightley is especially displeased
by what he immediately guesses was Emma’s role in the rejection,
and he states flatly, “You have been no friend to Harriet Smith.”
Emma counters that Harriet’s beauty and good temper, along with
the possibility that she is the daughter of a gentleman, make her
a desirable match. Knightley tells Emma that if she thinks Mr. Elton
will marry Harriet, she is wrong, because Elton will only marry
a woman with money. Vexed with one another, Emma and Knightley part
ways. Emma is comforted by the return of Harriet, who has heard
a rumor that Elton is on an important errand regarding a lady. Summary: Chapter 9  Emma and Harriet have been collecting riddles (also called
“charades”) into a scrapbook, and when Mr. Elton returns from London with
the framed portrait of Harriet, he contributes one. Emma immediately
decodes the riddle and sees that its answer is the word “courtship.”
She translates the riddle for Harriet, who could not solve it herself,
but Harriet is nonetheless flattered by its meaning. Emma convinces
Harriet that the riddle foretells a proposal, and she copies the
riddle into Harriet’s book. After some discussion among the family
anticipating the upcoming Christmas visit of Isabella, Mr. John
Knightley, and their children, Emma tells Mr. Elton that she has
solved his charade and copied it into Harriet’s book. Elton is clearly
moved, and Emma concludes that his emotion comes from seeing his
riddle in Harriet’s book. Analysis: Chapters 7–9 Chapters  Emma’s conversation with Mr. Knightley, in Chapter  	Sharing riddles was a common genteel pastime in the early
nineteenth century, and the riddle in Chapter  "
Chapters 16–18 ,"Summary: Chapter 16  
 	Back at Hartfield after her ride with Mr. Elton, Emma
plunges into self-recrimination as she looks back over the past
weeks. Her biggest regret concerns Harriet, whose feelings for Elton,
Emma realizes, are due mostly to Emma’s own encouragement. She decides
she need not pity Elton, because the artificiality of his addresses
suggests that he was more interested in her fortune than in herself.
She realizes that both of the Knightley brothers have been right
about Elton and that she has been wrong all along. Emma vows to
give up matchmaking, but she cannot stop herself from searching
for a new suitor for Harriet. 	The next morning, Emma is comforted by the reflection
that neither Elton’s nor Harriet’s feelings could have been very
strong and by the fact that no one else needs to know what has happened.
Several days of snow provide a respite, as everyone stays at home,
but Emma dreads telling Harriet what has happened. Summary: Chapter 17  Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley return to London, and Mr.
Elton writes Mr. Woodhouse to announce that he will spend the next
few weeks in the town of Bath. Relieved, Emma immediately visits
Harriet to explain what has happened. Emma’s sense of her own failures,
and Harriet’s modesty and sweetness in taking the news, give Emma
the temporary impression that Harriet, rather than herself, is “the
superior creature.” She moves Harriet to Hartfield and attempts
to comfort her and drive Elton out of Harriet’s mind. Emma tries
to prepare Harriet for the inevitable moment when they will see
Elton in their social circle after he returns from Bath. Summary: Chapter 18  Frank Churchill does not make his expected visit, to the
disappointment of Mrs. Weston in particular. Emma, preoccupied with
her other worries, does not mind, but she feels she must express
disappointment so that she will appear her usual self. Her warmth
in doing so gets her into an argument with Mr. Knightley about the young
man. Knightley expresses the same thought Emma has expressed: how
can a twenty-four-year-old man be prevented by his aunt from doing
his duty? In reply, Emma suggests that Knightley is a poor judge
of “the difficulties of dependence.” She expresses her sympathies
for Frank’s situation and her conviction that he would come if he
could, but Knightley counters that no sensible, honorable man would
be prevented from doing his duty. Emma predicts that Frank, when
he does arrive in Highbury, will be perfectly charming. Knightley
believes that Frank will be superficial and insufferable, and Knightley’s
prejudice against the stranger surprises Emma. Analysis: Chapters 16–18 Chapter  	However, Emma has not totally shed her former shortcomings. Emma’s
resolution to cease matchmaking is put in terms that suggest she
has gained a good deal of insight: “It was foolish, it was wrong,
to take so active a part in bringing two people together. It was
adventuring too far, assuming too much, making light of what ought
to be serious—a trick of what ought to be simple.” But soon she
is imagining new matches for Harriet, though she stops herself with
the recognition of her own relapse. Emma’s reflection that “there
had been no real affection either in [Elton’s] language or manners”
shows her continued sense of the superiority of her mind and manners
to Elton’s. She blames Elton probably more than he deserves for
her own mistakes, and her quick assumption that his feelings for
her were insincere seems self-serving. Her revised understanding
of Elton is accurate, but her refusal to implicate herself as party
to his misunderstanding shows that Emma’s self-understanding is
not complete. "
Chapters 13–15 ,"Summary: Chapter 13  The Woodhouses and Knightleys are invited to the Westons’
for Christmas Eve dinner. Harriet and Mr. Elton are also included,
but Harriet comes down with a sore throat and is forced to miss
the gathering. Emma meets Mr. Elton while visiting Harriet and is pleased
by his attentions to her friend, but she remains puzzled that he
refuses her suggestion to skip the party since Harriet will not
be there. Mr. John Knightley witnesses the exchange and suggests
to Emma that Mr. Elton has feelings for her. Amused, Emma dismisses the
suggestion. When she and Mr. Elton travel to the gathering in the same
carriage, she is surprised that Mr. Elton’s concern for Harriet gives
way to cheerful anticipation of the evening ahead. Summary: Chapter 14  Entering the party, Emma attempts to put Mr. Elton’s strange
behavior out of her mind, but his constant hovering presence makes
her worry that Mr. John Knightley’s suggestion that Mr. Elton cares
for her may be correct. Meanwhile, Mr. Weston announces that Frank Churchill
is due to visit in early January. Emma feels some interest in this
news because she has half-seriously thought of Frank as a potential
suitor, though she does not anticipate giving up her vow to remain
single. Mrs. Weston confides to Emma that she has some anxiety about
meeting her stepson, and she fears Mrs. Churchill will prevent him
from coming. She and Emma speculate about the situation at Enscombe,
the Churchill estate, and Emma wonders why a young man should be
so dependent upon the impulses of his guardian. Summary: Chapter 15  Mr. Elton joins Emma in the drawing room and displeases
her by acting more concerned with her health than with Harriet’s.
John Knightley’s report that it has begun snowing leads to a small
crisis, and Mr. Woodhouse and Isabella are beside themselves with
worry about traveling the three-quarters of a mile home. Mr. Knightley assesses
the situation and reassures everyone that they will make it back
safely. 	In the confusion created by the party breaking up, Emma
finds herself alone in one of the carriages with Mr. Elton. He immediately declares
his love for her and proposes. Hoping that he is merely drunk, Emma
attempts to remind him that Harriet is the true object of his affections.
Astonished, Elton assures Emma that he has never been interested
in Harriet. Moreover, he is convinced that Emma has known of and
encouraged his sentiments. Emma sharply rebukes him and refuses
his proposal, and the two travel the remainder of the journey in
angry silence. Analysis: Chapters 13–15 Emma’s belief that she is different from others cannot
merely be attributed to her sense of superiority; it also results
from her ambition to make her life more interesting and more useful
than the limitations of village life seem to allow. Observing and
imagining the destinies of other lives exercises her intellect.
We might think of Emma as a kind of novelist creating plots for
the characters that people her world. In this sense, she may be
closer to Austen than her mistakes would lead us to believe. In
fact, Emma is somewhat prudish, afraid to consider marriage for
herself, despite her belief that “a good match” is the key to happiness
for her friends. Alert to what she believes are the subtleties of
flirtation between Harriet and Mr. Elton, she is incapable or unwilling
to see that she might be engaging in such social games herself. 	Emma’s confrontation with Mr. Elton is the novel’s first
major crisis. The true turning point is not Elton’s proposal, however,
but his accusation that Emma has known that she was the object of
his affections all along. He says, “I am sure you have seen and
understood me,” and for the first time in the novel Emma is at a
loss for words, fiercely angry. This is the first instance in which
Emma is implicated in the social interactions that she believed
she was manipulating from a position of control and detachment.
She has understood her own calculating behavior as beyond reproach,
in a sense invisible, and suddenly she is seen and placed within
the society from which she believed she has separated herself, forced
to realize that she has been lying to both Harriet and herself. "
Chapters 31–33 ,"Summary: Chapter 31  Emma imagines the course that her and Frank’s love affair
will run. In her mind, her fantasy always ends with her refusing
Frank. She believes she loves him, but not so much that her happiness
depends upon him, and that he loves her, but that his feelings are
probably changeable. She reads his first letter to Mrs. Weston after
returning to Enscombe and admires the genuineness of the warm feelings Frank
expresses for Highbury. His brief mention of Harriet makes Emma
speculate that Harriet could replace her in his affections, but she
reaffirms her resolution to cease matchmaking. 	Village gossip turns to Mr. Elton, who will soon arrive
in Highbury with his new bride. Harriet is flustered by the prospect
of Elton’s return, and Emma suggests that if Harriet will not forget Elton
for her own sake, she should do so for Emma’s, for Harriet’s persistent
attachment is a reminder of Emma’s guilt. Harriet repents, and Emma
is moved by the warmth of Harriet’s love for her. Emma concludes
that tenderness of heart, which Harriet possesses and which Emma
believes she herself lacks, is tremendously valuable. Summary: Chapter 32  Mr. Elton returns with his bride, and Emma decides that
she and Harriet should visit the newlyweds early on in order to
reestablish normal social relations. In this first meeting and shortly
thereafter Emma reserves judgment on Mrs. Elton, and attributes
Mr. Elton’s lack of ease to the awkwardness of the situation. When
the couple returns the visit and comes to Hartfield, Emma is able
to observe Mrs. Elton at greater length, and Emma is horrified by
the over-familiarity of her manners. Mrs. Elton is attached to superficial tokens
of wealth, such as her sister and brother-in-law’s “barouche-landau”
(carriage); she presumes to take Emma under her social wing; and
she prides herself on the inner “resources” of self-worth and foresight
that she clearly lacks. Mr. Woodhouse, never particularly discerning,
considers the new bride pleasant enough and expresses guilt that
he has not visited her. He cannot understand Emma’s consternation
when he suggests that “[a] bride, you know, my dear, is always the
first in company,” and that a bride receives the utmost in politeness
and good manners. Summary: Chapter 33  Emma continues to dislike Mrs. Elton, who, noting Emma’s
reserve, begins to return the sentiment. Emma assumes that Mr. Elton
has told his wife something of the unfortunate episode with her
and Harriet, to whom the Eltons are especially rude. Mrs. Elton
takes on Jane Fairfax as her project, attempting to bring her out
socially. Emma is puzzled that Jane refuses another invitation to
join Mr. and Mrs. Campbell and Mr. and Mrs. Dixon in Ireland. She
is also puzzled that Jane accepts Mrs. Elton’s attentions, and she
discusses Jane’s actions with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley. Mr.
Knightley defends Jane’s acceptance of Mrs. Elton’s attentions,
and Emma takes the opportunity to probe Mr. Knightley on his feelings
for Jane, telling him, “The extent of your admiration may take you
by surprise one day or other.” Knightley seems flustered, uneasy,
and embarrassed and wonders whether Emma has been playing matchmaker
for him. She assures him that she has not, and he insists her that
he is not in love with Jane—for one thing, Jane is too reserved. Emma
is satisfied that she has been right about Knightley’s feelings for
Jane and that Mrs. Weston has been wrong, but Mrs. Weston wonders
if his eagerness in denying it indicates otherwise. Analysis: Chapters 31–33 In these chapters, Emma’s imaginative preoccupations again
shift their focus from meddling in others’ lives to understanding
the intrigue in her own. Earlier in the novel, Emma occupies herself
by envisaging Jane Fairfax’s supposed affair with Mr. Dixon, but
Jane’s reserve and Emma’s growing compassion for her have made this
line of speculation less worthwhile for Emma; now, for the first
time in the novel, Emma imagines herself as the heroine of her own
plot. Even so, her sentiments for Frank Churchill are no more real
than the feelings that she wrongly attributes to Mr. Elton, Jane,
and Mr. Knightley. Notably, her feelings for Frank flourish only
in his absence, which leaves Emma not unhappy but “busy and cheerful.” She
relishes the chance to envision her and Frank’s courtship, picturing
“a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment,
fancying interesting dialogues, and inventing elegant letters.”
She does not seem to relish the prospect of a courtship itself. 	Meanwhile, Mrs. Elton seems like a crude parody of the
earlier Emma, exhibiting Emma’s mistakes in an exaggerated form.
Mrs. Elton is constantly in search of young women to whom she can attach
herself and introduce into her society, and she holds matchmaking
an important goal. Emma immediately resents Mrs. Elton’s presumptuousness
in thinking she can make matches between strangers, and Mrs. Elton’s
blunt, outspoken nature makes us share Emma’s resentment. Still,
no great difference exists between Mrs. Elton’s behavior toward
Jane and Emma’s behavior toward Harriet, though Emma herself cannot
recognize the similarity. Both Emma and Mrs. Elton are guilty of
presumption. "
Chapters 22–24 ,"Summary: Chapter 22  In Highbury, there is great speculation about Miss Hawkins,
Mr. Elton’s fiancée. Mr. Elton returns to the village long enough
to confirm the rumors that his bride-to-be is beautiful, accomplished,
and of some fortune. Emma is relieved that his marriage will ease
the awkwardness of his return to their social circle, but she has
some uncharitable thoughts about Miss Hawkins’s inferior connections. She
has difficulty persuading Harriet to share her coolness, however. Only
the topic of Mr. Martin puts Mr. Elton out of Harriet’s mind. 	Harriet is flustered when Mr. Martin’s sister leaves
her a note at Mrs. Goddard’s. Emma decides that Harriet should return
the visit but stay only a brief time in order to reinforce the distance
that Emma, despite a twinge of conscience, believes Harriet must
maintain from the Martin family. Summary: Chapter 23  Emma takes Harriet to visit the Martins. Ahead of time,
they agree that Emma is to return and retrieve Harriet after fifteen
minutes. Harriet has a friendly and emotional visit with Mr. Martin’s
mother and sister, but when the visit is cut short, it is clear
the Martins understand that they have been slighted. Though pained,
Emma still believes she is doing what is best for Harriet. 	Emma’s spirits are revived by a meeting with Mr. and
Mrs. Weston, who bring the news that Frank Churchill’s arrival is
imminent. The following day, Emma unexpectedly meets Frank at Hartfield,
and she is pleased to find that he is very good-looking, bright, and
charming. Frank has just the right compliment for everyone, especially
Mrs. Weston, which pleases Emma. Emma can see that Mr. Weston hopes
that she and Frank might form an attachment, and she wonders if
the thought has occurred to Frank. When his father departs on an
errand, Frank leaves to call on his acquaintance from Weymouth,
Jane Fairfax. Summary: Chapter 24  Frank Churchill and Mrs. Weston visit Hartfield the next
day, and Emma is pleased by Frank’s warmth toward his stepmother.
He seems genuinely interested in everything about Highbury as the three
walk about the village, especially in the sites that are meaningful
to his father. Encountering an unused ballroom, he suggests that they
should organize a dance, and he dismisses Emma’s protestations about
the village’s lack of worthy families. 	Emma inquires about Frank’s visit with the Bateses, and
the two share impressions of Jane. Frank says that he finds her
unattractive and reserved. He thinks, however, that she is a talented
musician and affirms that they saw a good deal of each other in
Weymouth. Emma shares her theory about Jane and Mr. Dixon, which
Frank seems to resist, but then he gives in to Emma’s greater knowledge
of Jane. On the whole, Emma finds Frank even more to her liking
than she expected, possessing his father’s warmth and sociability
and lacking the proud airs one might acquire from the Churchills. "
Chapters 34–36 ,"Summary: Chapter 34  Fulfilling a social obligation, Emma plans a dinner party
for Mrs. Elton. Harriet asks to be excused from attending, which
gives Emma the opportunity to ease her conscience regarding Jane
Fairfax, who, at Harriet’s announced absence, is promptly invited
to fill the empty eighth seat. Mr. John Knightley is also included
because he will be in Highbury, accompanying his two eldest sons
on a visit to their aunt and grandfather. 	At the party, Mr. John Knightley gently reproaches Jane
for fetching letters from the post office that morning in the rain.
Jane acts as if the situation is not a big deal but ends up blushing
and watery-eyed, and soon the rest of the party begins discussing
the matter. Mrs. Elton insists that her servant should be given
the task of retrieving Jane’s letters, and Jane firmly resists.
The conversation moves to handwriting. Mr. Knightley praises Emma’s
penmanship but dissents when she praises the penmanship of Frank
Churchill. Jane’s eagerness to fetch her own letters rouses Emma’s
suspicions, but she decides not to trouble Jane by questioning her. Summary: Chapter 35  The women gather in the drawing room after dinner, and
Mrs. Elton pursues the subject of letter-retrieval with Jane. She
also insists on helping Jane find a governess position, though Jane
explains that she will not seek a place until after she sees the
Campbells in midsummer. The men come in, and Mr. Weston, who has
been on business in London, appears. He brings a letter from Frank,
reporting that Mrs. Churchill has decided that the household should
make an extended visit in London. This news means that Frank will
be able to be in Highbury a good deal. Mr. and Mrs. Weston are pleased, Emma
is somewhat agitated, and Mr. Knightley seems unexcited by the news. Summary: Chapter 36  Mr. Weston and Mrs. Elton have a long-winded conversation
in which they pursue comically different purposes. Mrs. Elton fishes for
compliments and goes on about Maple Grove, the estate where her
wealthy brother and sister-in-law live. Mr. Weston talks about Frank
and explains the illness of Frank’s aunt (and Mr. Weston’s sister-in-law),
Mrs. Churchill. Before the conversation becomes too heated, they
are interrupted by tea. Mr. John Knightley gives Emma final instructions
regarding his sons and wonders if they will be in the way at Hartfield,
now that Emma has become so social. She rejects John Knightley’s
implication and insists that she is more of a homebody than Mr.
(George) Knightley, who seems pleased and amused by the assertion. Analysis: Chapters 34–36 Austen’s use of three chapters to narrate a single dinner
party marks an interesting narrative development for English literature.
In novels by previous writers, the description of the events of
a dinner party would have taken up at most a page or two, but Austen
turns the dinner party into an opportunity to trace extensively
the ins and outs of human personality and interaction. In doing
so, she provides a model for later writers as disparate as Henry
James and Virginia Woolf. 	During the dinner party, we are given our first extended
view of Jane Fairfax, who begins to come out of her reserved shell
and speak more. Her well-crafted comments exemplify an ideal balance between
openness and propriety. For example, when Mr. John Knightley observes,
“When you have lived to my age, you will begin to think letters
are never worth going through the rain for,” Jane answers, “I must
not hope to be ever situated as you are, in the midst of every dearest
connection, and therefore I cannot expect that simply growing older
should make me indifferent about letters.” This answer is politely
vague but also expresses real emotion. It engages our pity, but
it tactfully avoids any suggestion of self-pity on Jane’s part.
Furthermore, when she firmly resists Mrs. Elton’s aggressive offers
of assistance, we realize that Jane’s quietness and reserve do not
indicate that she is dull or passive—she clearly has a mind of her own.
In fact, Jane is the character who voices the novel’s most explicit
social protest, which seems to come directly from Austen herself.
Jane speaks against the “governess-trade,” which involves “the sale,
not quite of human flesh, but of human intellect.” She admits that
offices that advertise for governess positions are less morally
deplorable than slave traders, but she adds, “[B]ut as to the greater
misery of the victims, I do not know where it lies.” "
Chapters 37–39 ,"Summary: Chapter 37  Emma thinks about her agitation upon hearing of Frank’s
impending arrival and decides that she feels such apprehension more
on his behalf than her own—her attachment to him is not very strong. When
she sees him again, he is friendly and spirited but visits for only
fifteen minutes. Frank’s short visit convinces Emma that his feelings
as well must have weakened. Because of his aunt’s demands, Frank
is kept away for ten days after this first visit. Mrs. Churchill eventually
determines that her family must move from London to Richmond, which
places Frank closer to Highbury. Mr. Weston is delighted to have
his son nearer, and a date is set for the long-postponed ball. Summary: Chapter 38  The day of the ball arrives. Emma is invited by Mr. Weston
to come early and give her opinion on the arrangements, and she
believes that this opportunity will give some privacy to her second
meeting with Frank, who will be with his father. But Emma is not
the only one of Mr. Weston’s “favourites” that he has entreated
to come early, and all the while Frank seems excited but restless,
constantly moving to see who has arrived. Finally, when Jane and
Miss Bates arrive, Frank rushes out to help them with umbrellas.
Mrs. Elton pronounces Frank a very fine young man. Miss Bates overwhelms everyone
with exclamations of gratitude and pleasure. Frank tells Emma that
he dislikes Mrs. Elton and her familiar manner with Jane, and he
runs off again to ask his father when the dancing will begin. 	Mr. and Mrs. Weston suddenly realize that Mrs. Elton
expects to be asked to lead the dance and that they cannot give
Emma that honor, as they had hoped. Despite this slight disappointment,
Emma enjoys the beginning of the festivities, though she is disturbed
that Mr. Knightley will not dance. She admires the figure he cuts
among the other men, and he notices that he is watching her. The
ball is a success, and only one episode mars Emma’s enjoyment. During
one dance, Harriet is left without a partner, and Mr. Elton, the
one dancer who is disengaged, pointedly refuses to ask her. Mr.
Knightley soothes Harriet’s embarrassment by asking her to dance,
and Emma is very pleased with him. Later, she expresses her gratitude, and
he asks her why the Eltons are her enemies. She admits that she wanted
Mr. Elton to marry Harriet and acknowledges that Knightley was right
about his character. Knightley in return admits that Harriet has
more admirable qualities than he originally thought. Emma and Knightley
cement their new mutual understanding with a dance. Summary: Chapter 39  Emma looks back on her talk with Mr. Knightley at the
ball with pleasure, and she rejoices that the Eltons’ rudeness has
cured Harriet of her infatuation with Mr. Elton. Suddenly, Frank
appears with Harriet, fainting, on his arm. When revived, Harriet
tells the story of how she was walking with a friend, Miss Bickerton,
when a Gypsy child approached to beg from them. Miss Bickerton,
frightened, ran away, but Harriet was unable to follow because of
a cramp she had gotten at the ball. Just as she started to panic,
a group of Gypsies surrounded her and demanded money. Frank happened
to be walking along and frightened the Gypsies away. Emma cannot
help but wonder whether this romantic circumstance might make Harriet
and Frank interesting to each other. The episode alarms Mr. Woodhouse and
is occasion for gossip, but the Gypsies leave the neighborhood and
no harm is done. Analysis: Chapters 37–39 Emma’s honest reflections about her lack of substantive
feelings for Frank reveal her growing maturity. She no longer sees
him as a character in the scenes she imagines for herself, someone
who is important simply because he gives her the opportunity to
show off her accomplishments and elegance. She recognizes that if
their two-month separation has not cooled his love, “there were
dangers and evils before her: caution for him and for herself would
be necessary.” Rather than anticipating a dramatic scene, she now
hopes that “she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration. That
would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance.”
Emma’s decision to observe Frank to see how he feels, rather than
to begin with an assumption about how he feels, enables her to understand
that Frank is not in love with her. The narrator makes clear that
Emma’s vanity is not at issue in this case—she is relieved, not
offended, that Frank’s feelings are cooled, and at the dance, she seems
to find more interest in puzzling about his odd mood than in courting
his attention. When Frank and Emma dance, instead of imagining how
elegant they look to others, she admires how elegant Mr. Knightley
looks. Emma has become more concerned with observing others, and
less concerned with being observed by others. 	The Gypsies Harriet describes encountering in Chapter  "
Chapters 40–42 ,"Summary: Chapter 40  Harriet comes to tell Emma that her infatuation with Mr.
Elton has passed and to relinquish the trinkets she has kept to
remember him by. First, she shows Emma a bit of court-plaster (used
at the time as a bandage) that she had lent to Mr. Elton when he
cut himself. He had used what he needed but discarded the rest,
which Harriet then kept. Emma feels guilty in recalling that she
had lied and said that she did not have any court-plaster, so that
Harriet would have the opportunity to be Elton’s healer. Harriet’s
second trinket is a useless bit of pencil Elton had discarded. She
throws both items into the fire, and Emma hopes that Frank might
take Elton’s place. Her hopes seem to be rewarded when, during another
conversation, Harriet says she will never marry, inciting Emma’s
suspicion that Harriet does not think that she will marry because
she is interested in someone of a higher class. After some hesitation,
Emma asks if Harriet has feelings for someone of higher rank. Harriet
says yes, and Emma comments that she is not surprised, given the
service that this person rendered Harriet. Emma says that they must
not discuss it anymore, and she advises Harriet to be cautious but
not to give up all hope. Summary: Chapter 41  Mr. Knightley begins to suspect that there is some secret
understanding between Frank and Jane. During a walk with Emma, Harriet,
Mr. and Mrs. Weston, Frank, Jane, and Miss Bates, Knightley witnesses
a strange exchange. Frank asks Mrs. Weston if anything has come
of Mr. Perry’s plan to buy a carriage. She has no idea what he is
talking about, and he swears that she wrote of it in a letter to him
some months ago. She denies it, and Frank decides he must have dreamed
it. Miss Bates remembers that there was talk of the Perrys getting
a carriage at her house (with Jane present) but that it was a secret.
Mr. Knightley observes Frank trying to catch Jane’s eye after this. 	The party reaches Hartfield, and Emma persuades everyone
to come in for tea. A word game ensues, which Mr. Knightley watches. Frank
constructs the word “blunder” using alphabet tiles, which he shows
to Jane. Then he constructs the word “Dixon,” shows it to Emma,
who laughs, and then shows it to Jane, who pushes the puzzle away
in anger. When the party breaks up, Knightley stays behind to speak
to Emma—he knows that everyone considers her the object of Frank’s
affection, and he wishes to warn her. Knightley asks Emma about
the “Dixon” joke, and, embarrassed, she refuses to explain. He tells
her his suspicion about Jane and Frank, and she laughs at him, stating
unequivocally that she can answer for Frank’s indifference to Jane.
Knightley is silenced and irritated by Emma’s implication that she
is in Frank’s confidence. Summary: Chapter 42  An outing to Box Hill is planned, but it has to be postponed
because of a lame horse. Mr. Knightley half-jokingly suggests that
the party come to his estate instead. Mrs. Elton seizes upon the
idea, and Knightley has to be firm to prevent her from planning
all the details. Meanwhile, the lame horse heals, and it is decided
that the Box Hill party will follow the one at Donwell Abbey, Knightley’s
estate. At Donwell Abbey, Emma enjoys examining Knightley’s house
and grounds. She overhears Jane resisting a governess “situation”
that Mrs. Elton has found for her. Walking through the garden, Emma finds
Harriet and Knightley looking out over the Martin family home and
thinks the two an odd grouping, but is nevertheless convinced that
Harriet is in good hands. Mrs. Weston is worried by the fact that
Frank is late coming from Richmond. At the house, Emma encounters
an agitated Jane, who asks her to tell everyone else that she has
walked home. Frank then turns up out of humor and in the course
of conversation says that he would like to go abroad. Emma teases
him out of his mood, and he promises to join the Box Hill trip. Analysis: Chapters 40–42 Even though Emma has resolved to use more discretion in
promoting a match between Harriet and Frank than she used when encouraging
Harriet’s affection for Mr. Elton, she manages to cause a misunderstanding
precisely because she shies away from explicit statements. When
Emma says of Harriet’s new object of affection, “The service he
rendered you was enough to warm your heart,” she is referring to
Frank, who saved Harriet from the Gypsies. Harriet, however, thinks
of Mr. Knightley, who saved her from humiliation by asking her to
dance. 	In the way it keeps us in the dark about the truth of
various characters’ feelings,  "
Chapters 43–45 ,"Summary: Chapter 43  
 The Box Hill trip is not a success. Mr. and Mrs. Elton
keep to themselves; Mr. Knightley, Miss Bates, and Jane form a second
exclusive party; and Emma stays with Harriet and Frank. Emma is
disappointed by Harriet’s and Frank’s dullness. Later, Frank becomes excessively
lively and gallant. Emma is confident that there is nothing behind
his flirtations, but she is aware that others can pick up on their
flirtation. The party sits about listlessly, and Frank says that Emma
demands to know what they are thinking of. Mrs. Elton is offended
by Frank’s deference to Emma, and Knightley asks dryly if she would  	Frank comments that sometimes matches made in public
places become regrettable on further acquaintance and that, as a
result, Mr. and Mrs. Elton are lucky that they are compatible. Jane
demurs and leaves for a walk with her aunt and Mr. Knightley. Emma,
left with Frank, grows tired of his flattery. Later, Mr. Knightley
takes Emma aside and reprimands her for her conduct toward Miss
Bates, reminding Emma that Miss Bates has had an unfortunate life
and deserves compassion. Emma has never felt “so agitated, so mortified,
[so] grieved” in her life; she cries almost all the way home. Summary: Chapter 44  On reflection, Emma decides that the Box Hill party was
a disaster. Still feeling horrible about her treatment of Miss Bates,
Emma soothes her conscience by visiting the Bateses first thing
the following morning. Miss Bates’s humility and kindness are a
further reproach to Emma’s bad behavior. During Emma’s visit, Jane remains
in the bedroom with a headache. 	Jane has just accepted the governess position recommended
by Mrs. Elton, and Emma expresses surprise and genuine concern for the
unhappiness Jane’s departure must cause everyone. Jane will leave
within a fortnight (two weeks). Emma is surprised to learn that
Frank departed the previous evening for Richmond, and she is struck
by the difference between Mrs. Churchill’s power and Jane’s. She
is ashamed of her earlier conjectures about Jane’s relationship with
Mr. Dixon. Summary: Chapter 45  Emma returns to Hartfield to discover that Mr. Knightley
and Harriet have arrived in her absence. Knightley is about to depart
for London to visit John and Isabella. His hastiness surprises Emma. Mr.
Woodhouse inquires about Emma’s visit with the Bateses, and Emma
blushes and exchanges a glance with Knightley. She believes he understands
her feelings and forgives her. He makes an unusual gesture, taking
her hand and almost kissing it. She is gratified, though a little
puzzled about his scruple in completing the kiss. 	The next day, unexpected news arrives: Mrs. Churchill
has died. Emma thinks this event may improve Harriet’s chances with
Frank. Meanwhile, she attempts to provide assistance to Jane, inviting
her to Hartfield, sending her healthful foods, and attempting to
visit her. Jane pleads ill health, but Emma hears that Jane has
been taking outside exercise, and she feels hurt that Jane seems
to be particularly avoiding her. "
Chapters 46–48 ,"Summary: Chapter 46  Mr. Weston arrives to escort Emma to see Mrs. Weston—clearly something
is amiss. Assured that Mrs. Weston is well, Emma’s first concern
is for Isabella’s family and for Mr. Knightley in London, but Mr.
Weston assures her that the news does not involve them. At Randalls,
Emma is greeted by Mrs. Weston, who explains that Frank has just
revealed that he and Jane have been secretly engaged. Emma is shocked,
embarrassed by the things she has said to Frank about Jane, and
concerned for Harriet’s feelings. 	Emma quickly relieves Mrs. Weston by assuring her that
she has no feelings for Frank. She is angry, however, about his
behavior toward her and Jane. Mrs. Weston defends her stepson, telling Emma
that there were misunderstandings between him and Jane and that
he will be writing her a letter detailing the extenuating circumstances.
Mr. Churchill has given his consent to the match, though he has
requested that it remain secret until more time has passed after
his wife’s death. Mr. Weston enters the room, and Emma assures him
that the news of Frank’s engagement has not caused her any pain. Summary: Chapter 47  
 	Emma is filled with concern for Harriet. She is angrier
at herself than she is at Frank, because she believes that she should
have discouraged Harriet’s attachment to him. Jane’s behavior since
her arrival in Highbury is also put into perspective. Emma realizes
that Jane has been avoiding her because she has seen her as a rival.
Emma dreads telling Harriet the news, but when Harriet arrives at
Hartfield she has already heard the story from Mr. Weston. Emma
is surprised at Harriet’s composure, and it turns out that Harriet
never cared for Frank; she has been harboring feelings for Mr. Knightley.
Harriet knows that Mr. Knightley is of higher rank than she, but
she affirms that Emma has given her hope that she may raise herself
enough to be acceptable to him. 	Emma makes a startling discovery—she herself is in love
with Mr. Knightley! She conceals her emotion from Harriet, asking
Harriet whether she has reason to believe that Knightley returns
her feelings. Harriet recounts a number of instances in which Knightley
has shown her special attention, many of which Emma’s memory corroborates.
When Harriet departs, Emma is left to reflect that she has been
wrong about everything, including her own heart. Now Knightley may
debase himself by marrying Harriet, and she has made it all possible. Summary: Chapter 48  Emma rethinks all of the events of the past months. She
realizes that it has always been important to her to be “first”
with Mr. Knightley and that he has always had special concern for
her, but she cannot believe he could return her feelings, especially
when he has just been so angry with her about her rudeness to Miss
Bates. She still believes she would not marry him, even if he asked,
because she cannot leave her father. She anticipates having the
opportunity to observe him and Harriet together. 	Mrs. Weston arrives to report that she has just visited
with Jane and that Jane admitted to having suffered a good deal
since entering into the secret engagement. She blames herself for
her misjudgment and acknowledges Emma’s kindness during her sickness.
Hearing this account, Emma again expresses anger at Frank’s behavior.
Mrs. Weston again defends him, though she has not yet received his explanatory
letter, but Emma is too distracted by her thoughts about Mr. Knightley
to pay attention. Emma regrets once more that she was not a better
friend to Jane, as Knightley had advised, and she reflects on how
desolate life will be without Knightley’s constant visits to Hartfield. "
Chapters 49–51 ,"Summary: Chapter 49  
 	Emma goes for a walk in the garden. To her surprise,
Mr. Knightley joins her. He has just returned from London. She worries
that Knightley will confess his feelings for Harriet, and she offers
her news about Frank and Jane’s secret engagement. Knightley already knows
about it and offers his consolation, but Emma assures him she has
never had feelings for Frank. She explains and expresses regret
for her behavior, and Knightley is strangely silent. Finally, he admits
he may have underrated Frank and expresses envy at his circumstances.
Worried that Knightley is about to discuss Harriet, Emma quickly
silences him. He is mortified, and seeing his pain Emma invites
him to speak after all, saying she will be glad to hear him as a
friend. He says he does not wish her friendship and declares his
love. She is surprised, thrilled, and by the time they reach the house
they are engaged to marry. Knightley is surprised as well—he was
convinced that Emma was in love with Frank; he departed for London
to cool his feelings for her, and he has returned thinking she would
need comfort. He has moved from resigned despair to perfect happiness
in half an hour. Summary: Chapter 50  Emma can barely conceal her feelings as she and Mr. Knightley
join her father for tea. That night, Emma lies awake worrying about Harriet
and her father. She decides she will write a letter to Harriet explaining
what has happened and arrange for Harriet to visit Isabella in London
to give both of them some time to adjust to the new situation. She
decides that she and Knightley must postpone their wedding until
after her father dies. 	Mrs. Weston forwards Emma a letter from Frank in which
he explains that all of his actions, including his attentions to
Emma, were guided by a need to maintain the secrecy of his engagement
to Jane. He apologizes for his behavior, but explains that he could
tell Emma was not attached to him, and says that he was under the impression
that Emma already knew about him and Jane. He adores Jane and is
miserable that he has made her suffer. The couple quarreled the
morning of the Donwell Abbey party because Jane was upset about
his behavior toward Emma, thinking it an inappropriate way to maintain
their secret. Frank was upset about Jane’s caution, which he interpreted
as coldness. Frank then left for Richmond, and Jane wrote to him
to break off the engagement. He received the letter from Jane the
morning his aunt died, and in the flurry of subsequent correspondence
failed to send his conciliating response to her. She sent his letters
back to him, indicating that he could return her letters at her
governess post. This was the first news Frank had heard of her new
position, and he threw himself at his uncle’s mercy, receiving approval
for the match. He then sped to Highbury to find Jane very ill. They
reconciled, and Frank admits that he is happier than he deserves
to be. Summary: Chapter 51  Emma, in her own happiness, cannot help but forgive Frank.
When Knightley comes to her, she shares the letter with him. He
reads the letter, telling Emma his impressions as he goes along,
and he is less softened than she but willing to admit that Frank
has some good qualities. He and Emma discuss her father, and he
agrees that Emma cannot leave Hartfield and that Mr. Woodhouse cannot
be expected to move to Donwell Abbey. He suggests that he move to
Hartfield, and Emma is moved by his sacrifice. She promises to think
it over, and soon likes the plan—her only sadness is that this engagement and

Chapters 52–55 ,"Summary: Chapter 52  Harriet agrees to Emma’s plan to send her to London on
the pretense that she needs to see a dentist, which satisfies Emma
since she does not want to hurt Harriet with news of Emma and Mr.
Knightley’s engagement. Emma decides not to tell her father of her
engagement until Mrs. Weston, who is pregnant, has given birth to
her baby. Meanwhile, she pays a visit to Jane. They are unable to
speak openly because Mrs. Elton is there, and Jane’s engagement
is still supposed to be a secret. However, Emma interprets some
of Mrs. Elton’s remarks and expressions as ostentatious indications
that Mrs. Elton is in on the secret of Jane and Frank’s engagement. 	Mr. Elton turns up, annoyed that Mr. Knightley has missed
a meeting with him. Emma decides he must be waiting for her at Hartfield
and leaves. When Jane walks her out, they are reconciled, each feeling
that she owes the other an apology, both full of goodwill. Summary: Chapter 53  Mrs. Weston safely delivers a baby girl, much to Emma’s
delight. Mr. Knightley reminisces about how headstrong Emma was
when she was a child. She expresses gratitude that he so often corrected her
mistakes, and he asserts that she would have done just as well without
him. Emma is grieved that she cannot speak more openly with him
about Harriet. Mr. John Knightley congratulates Mr. Knightley and
Emma on their engagement, and shocks the couple by saying that he
is not surprised by their news. 	Emma works up the courage to give her father the news.
Mr. Woodhouse is shocked, but he gradually begins to resign himself
to it. Mrs. Weston helps persuade him that his happiness will be increased
rather than diminished. She is surprised and overwhelmingly pleased
by the match. Mr. Weston shares the news with Jane and Miss Bates,
and soon Emma and Knightley’s engagement is the talk of Highbury.
Only the Eltons are displeased that Emma has made such a good match. Summary: Chapter 54  Mr. Knightley has news for Emma: Harriet is to marry Robert
Martin. Knightley had sent Mr. Martin to London with a package for
his brother while Harriet was there, and Mr. Martin began to spend time
with the family. Knightley worries that Emma is upset, but in fact
she is thrilled, amazed, and amused at Harriet’s rapid recovery. Emma
is thankful that she has not done Harriet greater injury, and she
is glad that soon she will no longer need to conceal Harriet’s emotional
state from Knightley. 	Emma and Mr. Knightley go to visit Randalls and find
Frank and Jane there. At first, Emma’s meeting with Frank is awkward,
but soon they are back on easy terms, joking about all that has
passed. Frank’s ability to speak lightly of all he and Jane have
suffered is not entirely approved by his fiancée, and Emma feels
Knightley’s superiority to Frank. "

Chapters 1–3 ,"Summary: Chapter 1  
 	The narrator opens the novel by introducing us to Emma
Woodhouse, a girl endowed with “some of the best blessings of existence,”
including good looks, intelligence, riches, and an affectionate father.
Emma’s only disadvantages are that she is slightly spoiled and that
she thinks “a little too well of herself.” Emma’s mother died before
Emma could form many memories of her, but her gentle governess,
Miss Taylor, provided a motherly love. After Emma’s older sister,
Isabella, was married and moved to London, Miss Taylor and Emma
became best friends. 	As the novel begins, Miss Taylor has just left Hartfield,
the estate of Emma and Mr. Woodhouse, to marry a widower named Mr. Weston,
and Emma is left without a companion. She attempts to comfort her
despondent father, who hates change, with the thought that they
will see the new Mrs. Weston often, but Emma only partially succeeds
in comforting herself. At this moment, neighborhood resident Mr.
Knightley, the brother of Isabella’s husband, pays a visit, having
returned from visiting their mutual relations in London. He affirms
the appropriateness of the match between Mr. Weston and Miss Taylor
and gently chides Emma when she claims credit. Emma declares that
she will repeat her matchmaking success by finding a wife for Mr.
Elton, the village rector. Summary: Chapter 2  The narrator recounts Mr. Weston’s history. His first
marriage was to a woman named Miss Churchill, who came from a higher
class than his. They had a son, named Frank, but the marriage was
overshadowed by the disapproval of Mrs. Weston’s brother and sister-in-law,
Mr. and Mrs. Churchill. When Mrs. Weston died after three years
of marriage, Frank was essentially adopted by Mr. and Mrs. Churchill
and made their heir. Mr. Weston, left impoverished by the expectations
of his first wife, spent the next twenty years of his life rebuilding
his fortune. He eventually purchased Randalls, the small estate
where he lives with the second Mrs. Weston. 	The village has always been curious to see Frank Churchill,
who writes a kind letter to Mrs. Weston indicating that he will
pay a visit to his father and stepmother. Summary: Chapter 3  The Woodhouses give a small dinner party, to which they
invite other members of their social circle: the widow Mrs. Bates;
her single, middle-aged daughter, Miss Bates; and Mrs. Goddard,
the mistress of the local boarding school. Mrs. Goddard brings one
of her boarders, Harriet Smith, a girl whose parentage is unknown.
Emma admires Harriet for her beauty and for her respect of Emma
and Hartfield. She resolves to pursue friendship with Harriet, and
to improve the naïve girl by detaching her from the inferior acquaintance
of the farming Martin family. She plans to introduce Harriet to
higher society. Analysis: Chapters 1–3 The narration of these opening chapters creates a complicated
portrait of Emma as a young, beautiful, clever, and confident character who
exercises her influence in a constricted and complex environment
and has much to learn about friendship, love, and the ways of the
world. Emma’s affection for Miss Taylor and her kindness to her foolish
and somewhat tiresome father reveal Emma’s capacity for true warmth
and generosity. But, at the same time, the narrator quickly alerts
us to the ways in which Emma is spoiled by her advantages and blinded
by her own self-regard. Most explicitly, we are told at the novel’s
beginning: "
Chapters 25–27 ,"Summary: Chapter 25  Emma’s good opinion of Frank Churchill is injured when
he makes a day trip to London just to have his hair cut. Though
Emma does not feel inclined to give up her vow to remain single,
she decides that Frank is pleasing enough that she does not mind
being associated with him in other people’s minds. Mr. Knightley
thinks Frank is a silly young man, just as he had suspected. 	Meanwhile, an invitation from the Coles, successful tradespeople
who live in Highbury, creates a conundrum for Emma. She had originally
decided that she would not accept an invitation from the nouveau-riche
family, but when everyone except the Woodhouses receives an invitation
to a dinner party at the Coles’ home, Emma feels left out. When
an invitation arrives, she decides to accept it. Summary: Chapter 26  Emma arrives at the Coles’ party behind Mr. Knightley.
Because Knightley usually walks, Emma is surprised that he has come
in his carriage. At dinner, it is revealed that Jane Fairfax has
received the mysterious gift of a pianoforte. People assume the
piano is from Colonel Campbell, but Emma tells Frank she suspects
that it is a gift from Mr. Dixon. When Jane arrives later, she blushes
when questioned about the piano. 	Meanwhile, Mrs. Weston tells Emma that Mr. Knightley
brought his carriage so that he could convey Jane home. Mrs. Weston
suggests that a match may be forming between Jane and Mr. Knightley, but
Emma resists this supposition vigorously, explaining that she cannot
bear the thought of Mr. Knightley marrying because then her nephew,
George and Isabella’s son Henry, will not be able to inherit Donwell
Abbey, the Knightley estate in the town of the same name. Mrs. Weston
suspects that Mr. Knightley is the one who sent Jane the pianoforte. 	Emma and Jane sing and play the piano for the company,
with Frank accompanying. When Frank persuades Jane to sing one more song
after her voice has begun to grow hoarse, Mr. Knightley intervenes.
Emma questions Mr. Knightley about the carriage and pianoforte.
His answers convince her that he did not send the gift, but do not
enable her to decide if he has feelings for Jane. When impromptu dancing
begins, she is relieved that he does not ask Jane to dance. Emma
is also pleased that Frank immediately asks her and not Jane for
a dance. There is time for only two dances, however, before the party
breaks up. Frank comments to Emma that he is lucky the dancing had
to end; otherwise he would have found himself asking Jane Fairfax
for a dance. Summary: Chapter 27  Emma is thoroughly pleased with her evening at the Coles,
but she is uncertain about the appropriateness of telling Frank
about her suspicions about Jane or acknowledging the superiority
of Jane’s musical abilities. At the Coles’ party, Harriet heard
that Mr. Martin had dined with the Cox family, and there is a rumor
that a Cox daughter would like to marry Mr. Martin. To distract
and protect Harriet, Emma accompanies her on a shopping trip. They
then decide to pay a visit to the Bates household and run into Frank
and Mrs. Weston on their way. The visit seems to have been Frank’s
idea, but he offers to stay with Emma and send Mrs. Weston to make
the visit on her own. Emma sends him along, knowing that he will
later come see her at Hartfield, but Miss Bates then comes into
the shop to ask Emma to come give her opinion of Jane’s new pianoforte.
In her rambling, Miss Bates reveals that Mr. Knightley has sent
his last apples of the season to Jane, who is particularly fond
of them. "
Chapters 28–30 ,"Summary: Chapter 28  Emma enters the Bates’ sitting room and finds Frank occupied
with fixing Mrs. Bates’s glasses and Jane seated at the piano. Frank
asks Jane questions about how she imagines the piano came to her,
and his comment, “True affection only could have prompted it,” makes Jane
blush. Believing that Frank is teasing Jane unkindly about Mr. Dixon,
Emma whispers that he should stop, and she regrets having shared
her speculations about Jane with him. Mr. Knightley stops by to
check on Jane’s health but refuses to come in when he hears that Frank
is there. Summary: Chapter 29  While the Woodhouses are visiting Randalls, Frank and
Emma work on planning a ball so they can finish the dancing inaugurated at
the Coles’. They decide the room at Randalls is too small. Mr. Woodhouse
privately tells Mrs. Weston his concern that Frank is so thoughtless
about opening and shutting doors that he exposes Emma, Harriet,
and Mrs. Weston to dangerous drafts. The next solution proposed
by Frank on behalf of Mr. Weston is that the ball be given at the
Crown Inn. Though Frank does a poor job reassuring Mr. Woodhouse
that this plan will not give them all colds, Emma comforts her father,
and she agrees to the plan. There are further practical difficulties,
and Frank proposes he go fetch Miss Bates along with her niece,
whom Frank admits he does not immediately recollect, for advice.
By the time he returns, the difficulties have been resolved, the
date of the ball has been set, and Frank secures from Emma a promise
to dance the first two dances with him. Summary: Chapter 30  Emma is worried that Frank’s aunt, Mrs. Churchill, will
refuse Frank permission to stay on for the ball, which is scheduled
for a few days after his visit is scheduled to end. To everyone’s
relief, he receives this permission. Only Mr. Knightley refuses
to look forward to the ball: he does not seem interested in dancing.
Emma takes Knightley’s diffidence as further proof that he is not
interested in Jane, who in a rare moment of openness confesses how
much she looks forward to the ball. 	Two days later, Frank is called back to Enscombe because
his aunt is ill. The ball is postponed indefinitely, and Frank comes
to Emma to say goodbye. He is clearly dejected and speaks haltingly—for
a moment, it seems as if he is going to declare something serious. Interrupted
by his father, Frank departs, and Emma is depressed. Highbury society
is, it seems for Emma, severely diminished without Frank’s charms.
Emma concludes that she must be “a little in love” with Frank after
all. Analysis: Chapters 28–30 During Emma and Frank’s visit to the Bates’, Emma, Frank,
and Jane are all aware that the dialogue taking place has a subtext,
but Austen crafts Frank’s words so that the subtexts Emma and Jane read
differ from one another. At this point in the novel, our misperceptions
are likely to closely match Emma’s, and we follow her in believing
that Frank’s teasing of Jane about the origins of her piano cruelly
refers to Mr. Dixon. Though Emma gossips maliciously about Jane, her selfless
protectiveness of Jane when she believes Frank to be teasing her
shows that Emma’s willingness to amuse herself at the expense of
another has limits. When we later learn that the piano is actually
a gift from Frank, Jane’s secret fiancé, we realize that his teasing
is more good-natured, emphasizing his own gesture of affection. "
Chapters 4–6 ,"Summary: Chapter 4  Emma and Harriet strike up an immediate intimacy as Harriet replaces
Mrs. Weston as Emma’s companion on her habitual walks. Emma remains
unimpressed with Harriet’s intelligence but appreciates her willingness
to be guided. Emma encourages Harriet to tell everything about herself,
and their conversation soon centers on the Martin family, which
Harriet has visited frequently over the past two months. Emma is
alarmed to learn that the family includes an eligible bachelor,
Mr. Robert Martin, and fears that her friend may have feelings for
him. A match between Harriet and Mr. Martin would be unacceptable
to Emma because the Martins are farmers, and therefore, in her opinion,
socially beneath her new friend. She discourages Harriet from thinking
well of Mr. Martin by asking questions about his education and predicting
that any wife Mr. Martin takes will be too inferior to merit friendship
with Harriet. After they run into Mr. Martin on one of their walks,
Emma encourages Harriet to compare his manners with those of the
gentlemen they know, praising Mr. Elton’s manners as particularly
genteel. The narrator reveals that Emma determined during the party
at Hartfield to encourage a match between Harriet and Mr. Elton. Summary: Chapter 5  Mr. Knightley and Mrs. Weston converse about Emma’s new
friendship with Harriet. Knightley believes that the friendship
is dangerous for both parties. Harriet’s flattery, Knightley suspects,
will reinforce Emma’s self-regard, while Emma’s influence will injure Harriet’s
happiness, because Harriet “will grow just refined enough to be
uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstance have
placed her home.” Mrs. Weston disagrees, believing that Emma needs
Harriet’s companionship and that Emma’s company will improve Harriet.
She advises Knightley to keep his mouth shut, and the conversation
ends with speculation about what will become of Emma. Noting Emma’s
declaration that she will never marry and her lack of suitable prospects,
Knightley comments that he “should like to see Emma in love, and
in some doubt of a return; it would do her good.” Summary: Chapter 6  Emma continues to point out Mr. Elton’s finer qualities
to Harriet and is convinced that he is already in love with her
friend. Mr. Elton praises the graces that Harriet has gained in
Emma’s company, and he quickly seconds Emma’s idea to paint a watercolor
portrait of Harriet. As Emma paints, Mr. Elton is only too attentive
to her progress, and though Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley point
out that Emma has exaggerated Harriet’s beauty, Mr. Elton emphatically praises
the portrait’s likeness. He volunteers to take the watercolor to
London to be framed. All the while, Emma continues to believe that
Mr. Elton’s enthusiasm is for Harriet, though Mr. Elton makes comments
on Emma’s skill in rendering and improving on the beautiful subject. Analysis: Chapters 4–6 Over the course of these three chapters, we learn that
Emma is extremely class-conscious and also somewhat manipulative.
She unattractively dismisses Robert Martin because of his social
class, saying, “The yeomanry [the class of farmers who hold land
under long- term leases] are precisely the order of people with
whom I feel I can have nothing to do. A degree or two lower, and
a creditable appearance might interest me; I might hope to be useful
to their families in some way or another.” In other words, Emma
is only interested in people who are of her social class or so far
beneath her that she might, from a comfortable position of superiority,
flatter herself by being “useful” to them. Such superior usefulness
is what Emma attempts with Harriet, and she even lies to her friend
in order to manipulate her. Although Emma observes to herself that
Mr. Martin’s “appearance was very neat and he looked like a sensible
young man,” she tells Harriet, “He is very plain … remarkably plain,
but that is nothing compared to his entire want of gentility.” 	Mr. Knightley and Mrs. Weston make Emma seem more likable than
she makes herself seem. Because Knightley shows himself to have
good sense, and also because he is the one character willing to find
fault with Emma, he is the novel’s most reliable mouthpiece for Austen’s
views of Emma. His discussion of Emma shows that he genuinely cares
for her but views her as a child lacking sense and understanding
rather than as an equal. He believes that Emma has been “spoiled
by being the cleverest of her family” but respects her stubbornness
and independence. He also admits that though Emma is very pretty,
she is not vain about her looks; “her vanity lies another way.”
Knightley’s pointed criticisms are offset by Mrs. Weston’s dismissive
remarks that Emma is a caring daughter, sister, and friend who “will
make no lasting blunder.” 	Like Austen’s narration, the dialogue between characters
frequently contains a subtext available only to certain characters
or to the reader. For instance, when Emma says to Harriet, “I wish
you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, when ever [Mr. Martin] does marry—I
mean as to being acquainted with his wife … it does not follow that
he might marry anybody at all fit for you to notice,” we admire
the cleverness of Emma’s suggestion to Harriet that Mr. Martin is
beneath her, even as we disapprove of Emma’s action. Chapter  "
Chapters 16–18 ,"Summary: Chapter 16  
 	Back at Hartfield after her ride with Mr. Elton, Emma
plunges into self-recrimination as she looks back over the past
weeks. Her biggest regret concerns Harriet, whose feelings for Elton,
Emma realizes, are due mostly to Emma’s own encouragement. She decides
she need not pity Elton, because the artificiality of his addresses
suggests that he was more interested in her fortune than in herself.
She realizes that both of the Knightley brothers have been right
about Elton and that she has been wrong all along. Emma vows to
give up matchmaking, but she cannot stop herself from searching
for a new suitor for Harriet. 	The next morning, Emma is comforted by the reflection
that neither Elton’s nor Harriet’s feelings could have been very
strong and by the fact that no one else needs to know what has happened.
Several days of snow provide a respite, as everyone stays at home,
but Emma dreads telling Harriet what has happened. Summary: Chapter 17  Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley return to London, and Mr.
Elton writes Mr. Woodhouse to announce that he will spend the next
few weeks in the town of Bath. Relieved, Emma immediately visits
Harriet to explain what has happened. Emma’s sense of her own failures,
and Harriet’s modesty and sweetness in taking the news, give Emma
the temporary impression that Harriet, rather than herself, is “the
superior creature.” She moves Harriet to Hartfield and attempts
to comfort her and drive Elton out of Harriet’s mind. Emma tries
to prepare Harriet for the inevitable moment when they will see
Elton in their social circle after he returns from Bath. Summary: Chapter 18  Frank Churchill does not make his expected visit, to the
disappointment of Mrs. Weston in particular. Emma, preoccupied with
her other worries, does not mind, but she feels she must express
disappointment so that she will appear her usual self. Her warmth
in doing so gets her into an argument with Mr. Knightley about the young
man. Knightley expresses the same thought Emma has expressed: how
can a twenty-four-year-old man be prevented by his aunt from doing
his duty? In reply, Emma suggests that Knightley is a poor judge
of “the difficulties of dependence.” She expresses her sympathies
for Frank’s situation and her conviction that he would come if he
could, but Knightley counters that no sensible, honorable man would
be prevented from doing his duty. Emma predicts that Frank, when
he does arrive in Highbury, will be perfectly charming. Knightley
believes that Frank will be superficial and insufferable, and Knightley’s
prejudice against the stranger surprises Emma. Analysis: Chapters 16–18 Chapter  	However, Emma has not totally shed her former shortcomings. Emma’s
resolution to cease matchmaking is put in terms that suggest she
has gained a good deal of insight: “It was foolish, it was wrong,
to take so active a part in bringing two people together. It was
adventuring too far, assuming too much, making light of what ought
to be serious—a trick of what ought to be simple.” But soon she
is imagining new matches for Harriet, though she stops herself with
the recognition of her own relapse. Emma’s reflection that “there
had been no real affection either in [Elton’s] language or manners”
shows her continued sense of the superiority of her mind and manners
to Elton’s. She blames Elton probably more than he deserves for
her own mistakes, and her quick assumption that his feelings for
her were insincere seems self-serving. Her revised understanding
of Elton is accurate, but her refusal to implicate herself as party
to his misunderstanding shows that Emma’s self-understanding is
not complete. "
Chapters 22–24 ,"Summary: Chapter 22  In Highbury, there is great speculation about Miss Hawkins,
Mr. Elton’s fiancée. Mr. Elton returns to the village long enough
to confirm the rumors that his bride-to-be is beautiful, accomplished,
and of some fortune. Emma is relieved that his marriage will ease
the awkwardness of his return to their social circle, but she has
some uncharitable thoughts about Miss Hawkins’s inferior connections. She
has difficulty persuading Harriet to share her coolness, however. Only
the topic of Mr. Martin puts Mr. Elton out of Harriet’s mind. 	Harriet is flustered when Mr. Martin’s sister leaves
her a note at Mrs. Goddard’s. Emma decides that Harriet should return
the visit but stay only a brief time in order to reinforce the distance
that Emma, despite a twinge of conscience, believes Harriet must
maintain from the Martin family. Summary: Chapter 23  Emma takes Harriet to visit the Martins. Ahead of time,
they agree that Emma is to return and retrieve Harriet after fifteen
minutes. Harriet has a friendly and emotional visit with Mr. Martin’s
mother and sister, but when the visit is cut short, it is clear
the Martins understand that they have been slighted. Though pained,
Emma still believes she is doing what is best for Harriet. 	Emma’s spirits are revived by a meeting with Mr. and
Mrs. Weston, who bring the news that Frank Churchill’s arrival is
imminent. The following day, Emma unexpectedly meets Frank at Hartfield,
and she is pleased to find that he is very good-looking, bright, and
charming. Frank has just the right compliment for everyone, especially
Mrs. Weston, which pleases Emma. Emma can see that Mr. Weston hopes
that she and Frank might form an attachment, and she wonders if
the thought has occurred to Frank. When his father departs on an
errand, Frank leaves to call on his acquaintance from Weymouth,
Jane Fairfax. Summary: Chapter 24  Frank Churchill and Mrs. Weston visit Hartfield the next
day, and Emma is pleased by Frank’s warmth toward his stepmother.
He seems genuinely interested in everything about Highbury as the three
walk about the village, especially in the sites that are meaningful
to his father. Encountering an unused ballroom, he suggests that they
should organize a dance, and he dismisses Emma’s protestations about
the village’s lack of worthy families. 	Emma inquires about Frank’s visit with the Bateses, and
the two share impressions of Jane. Frank says that he finds her
unattractive and reserved. He thinks, however, that she is a talented
musician and affirms that they saw a good deal of each other in
Weymouth. Emma shares her theory about Jane and Mr. Dixon, which
Frank seems to resist, but then he gives in to Emma’s greater knowledge
of Jane. On the whole, Emma finds Frank even more to her liking
than she expected, possessing his father’s warmth and sociability
and lacking the proud airs one might acquire from the Churchills. "
Chapters 7–9 ,"Summary: Chapter 7  Harriet receives a letter from Mr. Martin proposing marriage
and goes directly to Emma to seek advice. Emma acts as if there
is obviously no doubt that Harriet should not accept, and she proceeds
to offer Harriet advice about the wording of her refusal. When it becomes
clear that Harriet is doubtful about her answer, Emma becomes somewhat
cold and disingenuously states, “I shall not give you any advice,
Harriet. . . . This is a point which you must settle with your own
feelings.” When, under Emma’s subtle guidance, Harriet states that
she will probably reject Mr. Martin, Emma immediately congratulates
her friend on having made the right decision and points out that
if Harriet had accepted him, then Emma would no longer be able to
be her friend. Harriet immediately affirms that the loss of Emma
is unthinkable, and the two of them draft a letter refusing the
proposal. It is clear that Harriet is pained by her decision and
cares for Mr. Martin, but Emma cheers her up with reminders of Mr.
Elton. Summary: Chapter 8  With Harriet at Mrs. Goddard’s preparing for an extended
visit to Hartfield, Mr. Knightley and Emma have the opportunity
for a lengthy conversation about Harriet and Mr. Martin. Knightley reveals
that Mr. Martin has consulted him about proposing to Harriet, and
Mr. Knightley makes it clear that he supports the match. Emma informs
him that the proposal has already been made and rejected, and she
insists that Mr. Martin is not Harriet’s equal. Knightley very nearly
loses his temper, and he insists upon Mr. Martin’s superiority to
Harriet in sense and “true gentility.” Knightley is especially displeased
by what he immediately guesses was Emma’s role in the rejection,
and he states flatly, “You have been no friend to Harriet Smith.”
Emma counters that Harriet’s beauty and good temper, along with
the possibility that she is the daughter of a gentleman, make her
a desirable match. Knightley tells Emma that if she thinks Mr. Elton
will marry Harriet, she is wrong, because Elton will only marry
a woman with money. Vexed with one another, Emma and Knightley part
ways. Emma is comforted by the return of Harriet, who has heard
a rumor that Elton is on an important errand regarding a lady. Summary: Chapter 9  Emma and Harriet have been collecting riddles (also called
“charades”) into a scrapbook, and when Mr. Elton returns from London with
the framed portrait of Harriet, he contributes one. Emma immediately
decodes the riddle and sees that its answer is the word “courtship.”
She translates the riddle for Harriet, who could not solve it herself,
but Harriet is nonetheless flattered by its meaning. Emma convinces
Harriet that the riddle foretells a proposal, and she copies the
riddle into Harriet’s book. After some discussion among the family
anticipating the upcoming Christmas visit of Isabella, Mr. John
Knightley, and their children, Emma tells Mr. Elton that she has
solved his charade and copied it into Harriet’s book. Elton is clearly
moved, and Emma concludes that his emotion comes from seeing his
riddle in Harriet’s book. Analysis: Chapters 7–9 Chapters  Emma’s conversation with Mr. Knightley, in Chapter  	Sharing riddles was a common genteel pastime in the early
nineteenth century, and the riddle in Chapter  "
Chapters 31–33 ,"Summary: Chapter 31  Emma imagines the course that her and Frank’s love affair
will run. In her mind, her fantasy always ends with her refusing
Frank. She believes she loves him, but not so much that her happiness
depends upon him, and that he loves her, but that his feelings are
probably changeable. She reads his first letter to Mrs. Weston after
returning to Enscombe and admires the genuineness of the warm feelings Frank
expresses for Highbury. His brief mention of Harriet makes Emma
speculate that Harriet could replace her in his affections, but she
reaffirms her resolution to cease matchmaking. 	Village gossip turns to Mr. Elton, who will soon arrive
in Highbury with his new bride. Harriet is flustered by the prospect
of Elton’s return, and Emma suggests that if Harriet will not forget Elton
for her own sake, she should do so for Emma’s, for Harriet’s persistent
attachment is a reminder of Emma’s guilt. Harriet repents, and Emma
is moved by the warmth of Harriet’s love for her. Emma concludes
that tenderness of heart, which Harriet possesses and which Emma
believes she herself lacks, is tremendously valuable. Summary: Chapter 32  Mr. Elton returns with his bride, and Emma decides that
she and Harriet should visit the newlyweds early on in order to
reestablish normal social relations. In this first meeting and shortly
thereafter Emma reserves judgment on Mrs. Elton, and attributes
Mr. Elton’s lack of ease to the awkwardness of the situation. When
the couple returns the visit and comes to Hartfield, Emma is able
to observe Mrs. Elton at greater length, and Emma is horrified by
the over-familiarity of her manners. Mrs. Elton is attached to superficial tokens
of wealth, such as her sister and brother-in-law’s “barouche-landau”
(carriage); she presumes to take Emma under her social wing; and
she prides herself on the inner “resources” of self-worth and foresight
that she clearly lacks. Mr. Woodhouse, never particularly discerning,
considers the new bride pleasant enough and expresses guilt that
he has not visited her. He cannot understand Emma’s consternation
when he suggests that “[a] bride, you know, my dear, is always the
first in company,” and that a bride receives the utmost in politeness
and good manners. Summary: Chapter 33  Emma continues to dislike Mrs. Elton, who, noting Emma’s
reserve, begins to return the sentiment. Emma assumes that Mr. Elton
has told his wife something of the unfortunate episode with her
and Harriet, to whom the Eltons are especially rude. Mrs. Elton
takes on Jane Fairfax as her project, attempting to bring her out
socially. Emma is puzzled that Jane refuses another invitation to
join Mr. and Mrs. Campbell and Mr. and Mrs. Dixon in Ireland. She
is also puzzled that Jane accepts Mrs. Elton’s attentions, and she
discusses Jane’s actions with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley. Mr.
Knightley defends Jane’s acceptance of Mrs. Elton’s attentions,
and Emma takes the opportunity to probe Mr. Knightley on his feelings
for Jane, telling him, “The extent of your admiration may take you
by surprise one day or other.” Knightley seems flustered, uneasy,
and embarrassed and wonders whether Emma has been playing matchmaker
for him. She assures him that she has not, and he insists her that
he is not in love with Jane—for one thing, Jane is too reserved. Emma
is satisfied that she has been right about Knightley’s feelings for
Jane and that Mrs. Weston has been wrong, but Mrs. Weston wonders
if his eagerness in denying it indicates otherwise. Analysis: Chapters 31–33 In these chapters, Emma’s imaginative preoccupations again
shift their focus from meddling in others’ lives to understanding
the intrigue in her own. Earlier in the novel, Emma occupies herself
by envisaging Jane Fairfax’s supposed affair with Mr. Dixon, but
Jane’s reserve and Emma’s growing compassion for her have made this
line of speculation less worthwhile for Emma; now, for the first
time in the novel, Emma imagines herself as the heroine of her own
plot. Even so, her sentiments for Frank Churchill are no more real
than the feelings that she wrongly attributes to Mr. Elton, Jane,
and Mr. Knightley. Notably, her feelings for Frank flourish only
in his absence, which leaves Emma not unhappy but “busy and cheerful.” She
relishes the chance to envision her and Frank’s courtship, picturing
“a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment,
fancying interesting dialogues, and inventing elegant letters.”
She does not seem to relish the prospect of a courtship itself. 	Meanwhile, Mrs. Elton seems like a crude parody of the
earlier Emma, exhibiting Emma’s mistakes in an exaggerated form.
Mrs. Elton is constantly in search of young women to whom she can attach
herself and introduce into her society, and she holds matchmaking
an important goal. Emma immediately resents Mrs. Elton’s presumptuousness
in thinking she can make matches between strangers, and Mrs. Elton’s
blunt, outspoken nature makes us share Emma’s resentment. Still,
no great difference exists between Mrs. Elton’s behavior toward
Jane and Emma’s behavior toward Harriet, though Emma herself cannot
recognize the similarity. Both Emma and Mrs. Elton are guilty of
presumption. "
Chapters 34–36 ,"Summary: Chapter 34  Fulfilling a social obligation, Emma plans a dinner party
for Mrs. Elton. Harriet asks to be excused from attending, which
gives Emma the opportunity to ease her conscience regarding Jane
Fairfax, who, at Harriet’s announced absence, is promptly invited
to fill the empty eighth seat. Mr. John Knightley is also included
because he will be in Highbury, accompanying his two eldest sons
on a visit to their aunt and grandfather. 	At the party, Mr. John Knightley gently reproaches Jane
for fetching letters from the post office that morning in the rain.
Jane acts as if the situation is not a big deal but ends up blushing
and watery-eyed, and soon the rest of the party begins discussing
the matter. Mrs. Elton insists that her servant should be given
the task of retrieving Jane’s letters, and Jane firmly resists.
The conversation moves to handwriting. Mr. Knightley praises Emma’s
penmanship but dissents when she praises the penmanship of Frank
Churchill. Jane’s eagerness to fetch her own letters rouses Emma’s
suspicions, but she decides not to trouble Jane by questioning her. Summary: Chapter 35  The women gather in the drawing room after dinner, and
Mrs. Elton pursues the subject of letter-retrieval with Jane. She
also insists on helping Jane find a governess position, though Jane
explains that she will not seek a place until after she sees the
Campbells in midsummer. The men come in, and Mr. Weston, who has
been on business in London, appears. He brings a letter from Frank,
reporting that Mrs. Churchill has decided that the household should
make an extended visit in London. This news means that Frank will
be able to be in Highbury a good deal. Mr. and Mrs. Weston are pleased, Emma
is somewhat agitated, and Mr. Knightley seems unexcited by the news. Summary: Chapter 36  Mr. Weston and Mrs. Elton have a long-winded conversation
in which they pursue comically different purposes. Mrs. Elton fishes for
compliments and goes on about Maple Grove, the estate where her
wealthy brother and sister-in-law live. Mr. Weston talks about Frank
and explains the illness of Frank’s aunt (and Mr. Weston’s sister-in-law),
Mrs. Churchill. Before the conversation becomes too heated, they
are interrupted by tea. Mr. John Knightley gives Emma final instructions
regarding his sons and wonders if they will be in the way at Hartfield,
now that Emma has become so social. She rejects John Knightley’s
implication and insists that she is more of a homebody than Mr.
(George) Knightley, who seems pleased and amused by the assertion. Analysis: Chapters 34–36 Austen’s use of three chapters to narrate a single dinner
party marks an interesting narrative development for English literature.
In novels by previous writers, the description of the events of
a dinner party would have taken up at most a page or two, but Austen
turns the dinner party into an opportunity to trace extensively
the ins and outs of human personality and interaction. In doing
so, she provides a model for later writers as disparate as Henry
James and Virginia Woolf. 	During the dinner party, we are given our first extended
view of Jane Fairfax, who begins to come out of her reserved shell
and speak more. Her well-crafted comments exemplify an ideal balance between
openness and propriety. For example, when Mr. John Knightley observes,
“When you have lived to my age, you will begin to think letters
are never worth going through the rain for,” Jane answers, “I must
not hope to be ever situated as you are, in the midst of every dearest
connection, and therefore I cannot expect that simply growing older
should make me indifferent about letters.” This answer is politely
vague but also expresses real emotion. It engages our pity, but
it tactfully avoids any suggestion of self-pity on Jane’s part.
Furthermore, when she firmly resists Mrs. Elton’s aggressive offers
of assistance, we realize that Jane’s quietness and reserve do not
indicate that she is dull or passive—she clearly has a mind of her own.
In fact, Jane is the character who voices the novel’s most explicit
social protest, which seems to come directly from Austen herself.
Jane speaks against the “governess-trade,” which involves “the sale,
not quite of human flesh, but of human intellect.” She admits that
offices that advertise for governess positions are less morally
deplorable than slave traders, but she adds, “[B]ut as to the greater
misery of the victims, I do not know where it lies.” "
Chapters 37–39 ,"Summary: Chapter 37  Emma thinks about her agitation upon hearing of Frank’s
impending arrival and decides that she feels such apprehension more
on his behalf than her own—her attachment to him is not very strong. When
she sees him again, he is friendly and spirited but visits for only
fifteen minutes. Frank’s short visit convinces Emma that his feelings
as well must have weakened. Because of his aunt’s demands, Frank
is kept away for ten days after this first visit. Mrs. Churchill eventually
determines that her family must move from London to Richmond, which
places Frank closer to Highbury. Mr. Weston is delighted to have
his son nearer, and a date is set for the long-postponed ball. Summary: Chapter 38  The day of the ball arrives. Emma is invited by Mr. Weston
to come early and give her opinion on the arrangements, and she
believes that this opportunity will give some privacy to her second
meeting with Frank, who will be with his father. But Emma is not
the only one of Mr. Weston’s “favourites” that he has entreated
to come early, and all the while Frank seems excited but restless,
constantly moving to see who has arrived. Finally, when Jane and
Miss Bates arrive, Frank rushes out to help them with umbrellas.
Mrs. Elton pronounces Frank a very fine young man. Miss Bates overwhelms everyone
with exclamations of gratitude and pleasure. Frank tells Emma that
he dislikes Mrs. Elton and her familiar manner with Jane, and he
runs off again to ask his father when the dancing will begin. 	Mr. and Mrs. Weston suddenly realize that Mrs. Elton
expects to be asked to lead the dance and that they cannot give
Emma that honor, as they had hoped. Despite this slight disappointment,
Emma enjoys the beginning of the festivities, though she is disturbed
that Mr. Knightley will not dance. She admires the figure he cuts
among the other men, and he notices that he is watching her. The
ball is a success, and only one episode mars Emma’s enjoyment. During
one dance, Harriet is left without a partner, and Mr. Elton, the
one dancer who is disengaged, pointedly refuses to ask her. Mr.
Knightley soothes Harriet’s embarrassment by asking her to dance,
and Emma is very pleased with him. Later, she expresses her gratitude, and
he asks her why the Eltons are her enemies. She admits that she wanted
Mr. Elton to marry Harriet and acknowledges that Knightley was right
about his character. Knightley in return admits that Harriet has
more admirable qualities than he originally thought. Emma and Knightley
cement their new mutual understanding with a dance. Summary: Chapter 39  Emma looks back on her talk with Mr. Knightley at the
ball with pleasure, and she rejoices that the Eltons’ rudeness has
cured Harriet of her infatuation with Mr. Elton. Suddenly, Frank
appears with Harriet, fainting, on his arm. When revived, Harriet
tells the story of how she was walking with a friend, Miss Bickerton,
when a Gypsy child approached to beg from them. Miss Bickerton,
frightened, ran away, but Harriet was unable to follow because of
a cramp she had gotten at the ball. Just as she started to panic,
a group of Gypsies surrounded her and demanded money. Frank happened
to be walking along and frightened the Gypsies away. Emma cannot
help but wonder whether this romantic circumstance might make Harriet
and Frank interesting to each other. The episode alarms Mr. Woodhouse and
is occasion for gossip, but the Gypsies leave the neighborhood and
no harm is done. Analysis: Chapters 37–39 Emma’s honest reflections about her lack of substantive
feelings for Frank reveal her growing maturity. She no longer sees
him as a character in the scenes she imagines for herself, someone
who is important simply because he gives her the opportunity to
show off her accomplishments and elegance. She recognizes that if
their two-month separation has not cooled his love, “there were
dangers and evils before her: caution for him and for herself would
be necessary.” Rather than anticipating a dramatic scene, she now
hopes that “she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration. That
would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance.”
Emma’s decision to observe Frank to see how he feels, rather than
to begin with an assumption about how he feels, enables her to understand
that Frank is not in love with her. The narrator makes clear that
Emma’s vanity is not at issue in this case—she is relieved, not
offended, that Frank’s feelings are cooled, and at the dance, she seems
to find more interest in puzzling about his odd mood than in courting
his attention. When Frank and Emma dance, instead of imagining how
elegant they look to others, she admires how elegant Mr. Knightley
looks. Emma has become more concerned with observing others, and
less concerned with being observed by others. 	The Gypsies Harriet describes encountering in Chapter  "
Chapters 40–42 ,"Summary: Chapter 40  Harriet comes to tell Emma that her infatuation with Mr.
Elton has passed and to relinquish the trinkets she has kept to
remember him by. First, she shows Emma a bit of court-plaster (used
at the time as a bandage) that she had lent to Mr. Elton when he
cut himself. He had used what he needed but discarded the rest,
which Harriet then kept. Emma feels guilty in recalling that she
had lied and said that she did not have any court-plaster, so that
Harriet would have the opportunity to be Elton’s healer. Harriet’s
second trinket is a useless bit of pencil Elton had discarded. She
throws both items into the fire, and Emma hopes that Frank might
take Elton’s place. Her hopes seem to be rewarded when, during another
conversation, Harriet says she will never marry, inciting Emma’s
suspicion that Harriet does not think that she will marry because
she is interested in someone of a higher class. After some hesitation,
Emma asks if Harriet has feelings for someone of higher rank. Harriet
says yes, and Emma comments that she is not surprised, given the
service that this person rendered Harriet. Emma says that they must
not discuss it anymore, and she advises Harriet to be cautious but
not to give up all hope. Summary: Chapter 41  Mr. Knightley begins to suspect that there is some secret
understanding between Frank and Jane. During a walk with Emma, Harriet,
Mr. and Mrs. Weston, Frank, Jane, and Miss Bates, Knightley witnesses
a strange exchange. Frank asks Mrs. Weston if anything has come
of Mr. Perry’s plan to buy a carriage. She has no idea what he is
talking about, and he swears that she wrote of it in a letter to him
some months ago. She denies it, and Frank decides he must have dreamed
it. Miss Bates remembers that there was talk of the Perrys getting
a carriage at her house (with Jane present) but that it was a secret.
Mr. Knightley observes Frank trying to catch Jane’s eye after this. 	The party reaches Hartfield, and Emma persuades everyone
to come in for tea. A word game ensues, which Mr. Knightley watches. Frank
constructs the word “blunder” using alphabet tiles, which he shows
to Jane. Then he constructs the word “Dixon,” shows it to Emma,
who laughs, and then shows it to Jane, who pushes the puzzle away
in anger. When the party breaks up, Knightley stays behind to speak
to Emma—he knows that everyone considers her the object of Frank’s
affection, and he wishes to warn her. Knightley asks Emma about
the “Dixon” joke, and, embarrassed, she refuses to explain. He tells
her his suspicion about Jane and Frank, and she laughs at him, stating
unequivocally that she can answer for Frank’s indifference to Jane.
Knightley is silenced and irritated by Emma’s implication that she
is in Frank’s confidence. Summary: Chapter 42  An outing to Box Hill is planned, but it has to be postponed
because of a lame horse. Mr. Knightley half-jokingly suggests that
the party come to his estate instead. Mrs. Elton seizes upon the
idea, and Knightley has to be firm to prevent her from planning
all the details. Meanwhile, the lame horse heals, and it is decided
that the Box Hill party will follow the one at Donwell Abbey, Knightley’s
estate. At Donwell Abbey, Emma enjoys examining Knightley’s house
and grounds. She overhears Jane resisting a governess “situation”
that Mrs. Elton has found for her. Walking through the garden, Emma finds
Harriet and Knightley looking out over the Martin family home and
thinks the two an odd grouping, but is nevertheless convinced that
Harriet is in good hands. Mrs. Weston is worried by the fact that
Frank is late coming from Richmond. At the house, Emma encounters
an agitated Jane, who asks her to tell everyone else that she has
walked home. Frank then turns up out of humor and in the course
of conversation says that he would like to go abroad. Emma teases
him out of his mood, and he promises to join the Box Hill trip. Analysis: Chapters 40–42 Even though Emma has resolved to use more discretion in
promoting a match between Harriet and Frank than she used when encouraging
Harriet’s affection for Mr. Elton, she manages to cause a misunderstanding
precisely because she shies away from explicit statements. When
Emma says of Harriet’s new object of affection, “The service he
rendered you was enough to warm your heart,” she is referring to
Frank, who saved Harriet from the Gypsies. Harriet, however, thinks
of Mr. Knightley, who saved her from humiliation by asking her to
dance. 	In the way it keeps us in the dark about the truth of
various characters’ feelings,  "
Chapters 43–45 ,"Summary: Chapter 43  
 The Box Hill trip is not a success. Mr. and Mrs. Elton
keep to themselves; Mr. Knightley, Miss Bates, and Jane form a second
exclusive party; and Emma stays with Harriet and Frank. Emma is
disappointed by Harriet’s and Frank’s dullness. Later, Frank becomes excessively
lively and gallant. Emma is confident that there is nothing behind
his flirtations, but she is aware that others can pick up on their
flirtation. The party sits about listlessly, and Frank says that Emma
demands to know what they are thinking of. Mrs. Elton is offended
by Frank’s deference to Emma, and Knightley asks dryly if she would  	Frank comments that sometimes matches made in public
places become regrettable on further acquaintance and that, as a
result, Mr. and Mrs. Elton are lucky that they are compatible. Jane
demurs and leaves for a walk with her aunt and Mr. Knightley. Emma,
left with Frank, grows tired of his flattery. Later, Mr. Knightley
takes Emma aside and reprimands her for her conduct toward Miss
Bates, reminding Emma that Miss Bates has had an unfortunate life
and deserves compassion. Emma has never felt “so agitated, so mortified,
[so] grieved” in her life; she cries almost all the way home. Summary: Chapter 44  On reflection, Emma decides that the Box Hill party was
a disaster. Still feeling horrible about her treatment of Miss Bates,
Emma soothes her conscience by visiting the Bateses first thing
the following morning. Miss Bates’s humility and kindness are a
further reproach to Emma’s bad behavior. During Emma’s visit, Jane remains
in the bedroom with a headache. 	Jane has just accepted the governess position recommended
by Mrs. Elton, and Emma expresses surprise and genuine concern for the
unhappiness Jane’s departure must cause everyone. Jane will leave
within a fortnight (two weeks). Emma is surprised to learn that
Frank departed the previous evening for Richmond, and she is struck
by the difference between Mrs. Churchill’s power and Jane’s. She
is ashamed of her earlier conjectures about Jane’s relationship with
Mr. Dixon. Summary: Chapter 45  Emma returns to Hartfield to discover that Mr. Knightley
and Harriet have arrived in her absence. Knightley is about to depart
for London to visit John and Isabella. His hastiness surprises Emma. Mr.
Woodhouse inquires about Emma’s visit with the Bateses, and Emma
blushes and exchanges a glance with Knightley. She believes he understands
her feelings and forgives her. He makes an unusual gesture, taking
her hand and almost kissing it. She is gratified, though a little
puzzled about his scruple in completing the kiss. 	The next day, unexpected news arrives: Mrs. Churchill
has died. Emma thinks this event may improve Harriet’s chances with
Frank. Meanwhile, she attempts to provide assistance to Jane, inviting
her to Hartfield, sending her healthful foods, and attempting to
visit her. Jane pleads ill health, but Emma hears that Jane has
been taking outside exercise, and she feels hurt that Jane seems
to be particularly avoiding her. "
Chapters 13–15 ,"Summary: Chapter 13  The Woodhouses and Knightleys are invited to the Westons’
for Christmas Eve dinner. Harriet and Mr. Elton are also included,
but Harriet comes down with a sore throat and is forced to miss
the gathering. Emma meets Mr. Elton while visiting Harriet and is pleased
by his attentions to her friend, but she remains puzzled that he
refuses her suggestion to skip the party since Harriet will not
be there. Mr. John Knightley witnesses the exchange and suggests
to Emma that Mr. Elton has feelings for her. Amused, Emma dismisses the
suggestion. When she and Mr. Elton travel to the gathering in the same
carriage, she is surprised that Mr. Elton’s concern for Harriet gives
way to cheerful anticipation of the evening ahead. Summary: Chapter 14  Entering the party, Emma attempts to put Mr. Elton’s strange
behavior out of her mind, but his constant hovering presence makes
her worry that Mr. John Knightley’s suggestion that Mr. Elton cares
for her may be correct. Meanwhile, Mr. Weston announces that Frank Churchill
is due to visit in early January. Emma feels some interest in this
news because she has half-seriously thought of Frank as a potential
suitor, though she does not anticipate giving up her vow to remain
single. Mrs. Weston confides to Emma that she has some anxiety about
meeting her stepson, and she fears Mrs. Churchill will prevent him
from coming. She and Emma speculate about the situation at Enscombe,
the Churchill estate, and Emma wonders why a young man should be
so dependent upon the impulses of his guardian. Summary: Chapter 15  Mr. Elton joins Emma in the drawing room and displeases
her by acting more concerned with her health than with Harriet’s.
John Knightley’s report that it has begun snowing leads to a small
crisis, and Mr. Woodhouse and Isabella are beside themselves with
worry about traveling the three-quarters of a mile home. Mr. Knightley assesses
the situation and reassures everyone that they will make it back
safely. 	In the confusion created by the party breaking up, Emma
finds herself alone in one of the carriages with Mr. Elton. He immediately declares
his love for her and proposes. Hoping that he is merely drunk, Emma
attempts to remind him that Harriet is the true object of his affections.
Astonished, Elton assures Emma that he has never been interested
in Harriet. Moreover, he is convinced that Emma has known of and
encouraged his sentiments. Emma sharply rebukes him and refuses
his proposal, and the two travel the remainder of the journey in
angry silence. Analysis: Chapters 13–15 Emma’s belief that she is different from others cannot
merely be attributed to her sense of superiority; it also results
from her ambition to make her life more interesting and more useful
than the limitations of village life seem to allow. Observing and
imagining the destinies of other lives exercises her intellect.
We might think of Emma as a kind of novelist creating plots for
the characters that people her world. In this sense, she may be
closer to Austen than her mistakes would lead us to believe. In
fact, Emma is somewhat prudish, afraid to consider marriage for
herself, despite her belief that “a good match” is the key to happiness
for her friends. Alert to what she believes are the subtleties of
flirtation between Harriet and Mr. Elton, she is incapable or unwilling
to see that she might be engaging in such social games herself. 	Emma’s confrontation with Mr. Elton is the novel’s first
major crisis. The true turning point is not Elton’s proposal, however,
but his accusation that Emma has known that she was the object of
his affections all along. He says, “I am sure you have seen and
understood me,” and for the first time in the novel Emma is at a
loss for words, fiercely angry. This is the first instance in which
Emma is implicated in the social interactions that she believed
she was manipulating from a position of control and detachment.
She has understood her own calculating behavior as beyond reproach,
in a sense invisible, and suddenly she is seen and placed within
the society from which she believed she has separated herself, forced
to realize that she has been lying to both Harriet and herself. "
Chapters 46–48 ,"Summary: Chapter 46  Mr. Weston arrives to escort Emma to see Mrs. Weston—clearly something
is amiss. Assured that Mrs. Weston is well, Emma’s first concern
is for Isabella’s family and for Mr. Knightley in London, but Mr.
Weston assures her that the news does not involve them. At Randalls,
Emma is greeted by Mrs. Weston, who explains that Frank has just
revealed that he and Jane have been secretly engaged. Emma is shocked,
embarrassed by the things she has said to Frank about Jane, and
concerned for Harriet’s feelings. 	Emma quickly relieves Mrs. Weston by assuring her that
she has no feelings for Frank. She is angry, however, about his
behavior toward her and Jane. Mrs. Weston defends her stepson, telling Emma
that there were misunderstandings between him and Jane and that
he will be writing her a letter detailing the extenuating circumstances.
Mr. Churchill has given his consent to the match, though he has
requested that it remain secret until more time has passed after
his wife’s death. Mr. Weston enters the room, and Emma assures him
that the news of Frank’s engagement has not caused her any pain. Summary: Chapter 47  
 	Emma is filled with concern for Harriet. She is angrier
at herself than she is at Frank, because she believes that she should
have discouraged Harriet’s attachment to him. Jane’s behavior since
her arrival in Highbury is also put into perspective. Emma realizes
that Jane has been avoiding her because she has seen her as a rival.
Emma dreads telling Harriet the news, but when Harriet arrives at
Hartfield she has already heard the story from Mr. Weston. Emma
is surprised at Harriet’s composure, and it turns out that Harriet
never cared for Frank; she has been harboring feelings for Mr. Knightley.
Harriet knows that Mr. Knightley is of higher rank than she, but
she affirms that Emma has given her hope that she may raise herself
enough to be acceptable to him. 	Emma makes a startling discovery—she herself is in love
with Mr. Knightley! She conceals her emotion from Harriet, asking
Harriet whether she has reason to believe that Knightley returns
her feelings. Harriet recounts a number of instances in which Knightley
has shown her special attention, many of which Emma’s memory corroborates.
When Harriet departs, Emma is left to reflect that she has been
wrong about everything, including her own heart. Now Knightley may
debase himself by marrying Harriet, and she has made it all possible. Summary: Chapter 48  Emma rethinks all of the events of the past months. She
realizes that it has always been important to her to be “first”
with Mr. Knightley and that he has always had special concern for
her, but she cannot believe he could return her feelings, especially
when he has just been so angry with her about her rudeness to Miss
Bates. She still believes she would not marry him, even if he asked,
because she cannot leave her father. She anticipates having the
opportunity to observe him and Harriet together. 	Mrs. Weston arrives to report that she has just visited
with Jane and that Jane admitted to having suffered a good deal
since entering into the secret engagement. She blames herself for
her misjudgment and acknowledges Emma’s kindness during her sickness.
Hearing this account, Emma again expresses anger at Frank’s behavior.
Mrs. Weston again defends him, though she has not yet received his explanatory
letter, but Emma is too distracted by her thoughts about Mr. Knightley
to pay attention. Emma regrets once more that she was not a better
friend to Jane, as Knightley had advised, and she reflects on how
desolate life will be without Knightley’s constant visits to Hartfield. "
Chapters 19–21 ,"Summary: Chapter 19  During a walk, Emma has little success turning Harriet’s
thoughts from Mr. Elton and therefore decides that they should call
on Mrs. and Miss Bates, a duty that Emma usually shuns. During their
visit, they are forced to hear about Mr. Elton and his travels,
and though Emma has tried to time her visit so as to avoid hearing
about Miss Bates’s niece, Jane Fairfax, Miss Bates produces a letter
from Jane, who lives with her guardians, Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.
The Campbells are about to visit their newly married daughter, Mrs. Dixon,
in Ireland, which means that Jane will be coming for an extended
visit in Highbury in a week’s time. Based on slight evidence, Emma
suspects that there has been a romance between Jane and the Campbells’
daughter’s husband, Mr. Dixon, and that this is the reason that
Jane is missing the trip to Ireland. Summary: Chapter 20  Jane’s history is given, starting from how, at age three,
she became an orphan after her father was killed in battle and her
mother died of consumption and grief. Jane lived with her aunt and
grandmother in Highbury until she was eight years old. Then, a friend
of her father’s, Colonel Campbell, took an interest in her well-being
and made her part of his household. He provided her with an education, but,
since he would be unable to give her an inheritance, it was understood
that when Jane came of age she would become a governess. Meanwhile,
Jane became dear to the Campbell family and enjoyed the pleasures
of elegant society in London. Her stay in Highbury constitutes her
last taste of freedom before becoming a governess. 	Jane arrives, and Emma greets the girl’s return after
two years’ absence with mixed feelings. She has never liked Jane,
for reasons she cannot fully explain (Mr. Knightley suggests to
her that she is jealous), but Jane’s beauty impresses her, and she
feels compassion for her impending fate. Soon the dullness of Jane’s
companions, along with Jane’s reserve, confirms Emma’s dislike.
Emma discovers that Jane has known Frank Churchill in Weymouth,
but Jane divulges little information about him. Summary: Chapter 21  Just as Mr. Knightley is about to give Emma some news,
the Bateses arrive with Jane to thank the Woodhouses for the hindquarter
of pork they have sent; they manage to precede Knightley in divulging that
Mr. Elton is to marry a Miss Hawkins. Emma is caught off guard,
and Mr. Knightley’s looks suggest he knows something of what has
transpired between them. However, she soon regains enough composure
to make another failed attempt to engage Jane in conversation. The
company departs, and Harriet bursts in with news that she has run
into Mr. Martin and his sister in town. She relates that after some
awkwardness, the pair greeted her with kindness, leaving Harriet
flustered. Emma is impressed by the Martins’ behavior and briefly
second-guesses her judgment of them, but she concludes that their
station in life is still too low for Harriet. She is only able to
distract Harriet from the episode by sharing the news of Mr. Elton’s
impending marriage. Analysis: Chapters 19–21 Miss Bates’s repetitious speeches, and the mileage she
can get from a single letter or piece of news from someone outside
of Highbury, strongly reinforce our sense of the claustrophobia
of village life. Though the character of Miss Bates is considered
a comic masterpiece, there is also a pathetic and even alarming
quality to the narrowness of her experience. In contrast to more
sophisticated and calculating characters such as Emma and Mr. Knightley,
who conceal or reveal what they are thinking depending upon the
appropriateness of the situation and the effect they wish to produce,
Miss Bates narrates everything that passes through her head, all
of it more or less harmless. 	With a more developed sense of Miss Bates’s character,
Austen provides some distinctly different views of women’s experience
in Highbury. She makes an implicit statement about intelligence
and its potential for creating hardship when she contrasts Emma
and Miss Bates. For instance, Miss Bates speaks in absurdly long,
digressive sentences, interrupting herself frequently and often
forgetting her point. In one example, she says: "
Chapters 49–51 ,"Summary: Chapter 49  
 	Emma goes for a walk in the garden. To her surprise,
Mr. Knightley joins her. He has just returned from London. She worries
that Knightley will confess his feelings for Harriet, and she offers
her news about Frank and Jane’s secret engagement. Knightley already knows
about it and offers his consolation, but Emma assures him she has
never had feelings for Frank. She explains and expresses regret
for her behavior, and Knightley is strangely silent. Finally, he admits
he may have underrated Frank and expresses envy at his circumstances.
Worried that Knightley is about to discuss Harriet, Emma quickly
silences him. He is mortified, and seeing his pain Emma invites
him to speak after all, saying she will be glad to hear him as a
friend. He says he does not wish her friendship and declares his
love. She is surprised, thrilled, and by the time they reach the house
they are engaged to marry. Knightley is surprised as well—he was
convinced that Emma was in love with Frank; he departed for London
to cool his feelings for her, and he has returned thinking she would
need comfort. He has moved from resigned despair to perfect happiness
in half an hour. Summary: Chapter 50  Emma can barely conceal her feelings as she and Mr. Knightley
join her father for tea. That night, Emma lies awake worrying about Harriet
and her father. She decides she will write a letter to Harriet explaining
what has happened and arrange for Harriet to visit Isabella in London
to give both of them some time to adjust to the new situation. She
decides that she and Knightley must postpone their wedding until
after her father dies. 	Mrs. Weston forwards Emma a letter from Frank in which
he explains that all of his actions, including his attentions to
Emma, were guided by a need to maintain the secrecy of his engagement
to Jane. He apologizes for his behavior, but explains that he could
tell Emma was not attached to him, and says that he was under the impression
that Emma already knew about him and Jane. He adores Jane and is
miserable that he has made her suffer. The couple quarreled the
morning of the Donwell Abbey party because Jane was upset about
his behavior toward Emma, thinking it an inappropriate way to maintain
their secret. Frank was upset about Jane’s caution, which he interpreted
as coldness. Frank then left for Richmond, and Jane wrote to him
to break off the engagement. He received the letter from Jane the
morning his aunt died, and in the flurry of subsequent correspondence
failed to send his conciliating response to her. She sent his letters
back to him, indicating that he could return her letters at her
governess post. This was the first news Frank had heard of her new
position, and he threw himself at his uncle’s mercy, receiving approval
for the match. He then sped to Highbury to find Jane very ill. They
reconciled, and Frank admits that he is happier than he deserves
to be. Summary: Chapter 51  Emma, in her own happiness, cannot help but forgive Frank.
When Knightley comes to her, she shares the letter with him. He
reads the letter, telling Emma his impressions as he goes along,
and he is less softened than she but willing to admit that Frank
has some good qualities. He and Emma discuss her father, and he
agrees that Emma cannot leave Hartfield and that Mr. Woodhouse cannot
be expected to move to Donwell Abbey. He suggests that he move to
Hartfield, and Emma is moved by his sacrifice. She promises to think
it over, and soon likes the plan—her only sadness is that this engagement and
relocation will estrange her and Harriet further. Analysis: Chapters 49–51 Nearly every sentence that passes between Emma and Knightley
in Chapter  	The emotional release of Chapter  "
Chapters 52–55 ,"Summary: Chapter 52  Harriet agrees to Emma’s plan to send her to London on
the pretense that she needs to see a dentist, which satisfies Emma
since she does not want to hurt Harriet with news of Emma and Mr.
Knightley’s engagement. Emma decides not to tell her father of her
engagement until Mrs. Weston, who is pregnant, has given birth to
her baby. Meanwhile, she pays a visit to Jane. They are unable to
speak openly because Mrs. Elton is there, and Jane’s engagement
is still supposed to be a secret. However, Emma interprets some
of Mrs. Elton’s remarks and expressions as ostentatious indications
that Mrs. Elton is in on the secret of Jane and Frank’s engagement. 	Mr. Elton turns up, annoyed that Mr. Knightley has missed
a meeting with him. Emma decides he must be waiting for her at Hartfield
and leaves. When Jane walks her out, they are reconciled, each feeling
that she owes the other an apology, both full of goodwill. Summary: Chapter 53  Mrs. Weston safely delivers a baby girl, much to Emma’s
delight. Mr. Knightley reminisces about how headstrong Emma was
when she was a child. She expresses gratitude that he so often corrected her
mistakes, and he asserts that she would have done just as well without
him. Emma is grieved that she cannot speak more openly with him
about Harriet. Mr. John Knightley congratulates Mr. Knightley and
Emma on their engagement, and shocks the couple by saying that he
is not surprised by their news. 	Emma works up the courage to give her father the news.
Mr. Woodhouse is shocked, but he gradually begins to resign himself
to it. Mrs. Weston helps persuade him that his happiness will be increased
rather than diminished. She is surprised and overwhelmingly pleased
by the match. Mr. Weston shares the news with Jane and Miss Bates,
and soon Emma and Knightley’s engagement is the talk of Highbury.
Only the Eltons are displeased that Emma has made such a good match. Summary: Chapter 54  Mr. Knightley has news for Emma: Harriet is to marry Robert
Martin. Knightley had sent Mr. Martin to London with a package for
his brother while Harriet was there, and Mr. Martin began to spend time
with the family. Knightley worries that Emma is upset, but in fact
she is thrilled, amazed, and amused at Harriet’s rapid recovery. Emma
is thankful that she has not done Harriet greater injury, and she
is glad that soon she will no longer need to conceal Harriet’s emotional
state from Knightley. 	Emma and Mr. Knightley go to visit Randalls and find
Frank and Jane there. At first, Emma’s meeting with Frank is awkward,
but soon they are back on easy terms, joking about all that has
passed. Frank’s ability to speak lightly of all he and Jane have
suffered is not entirely approved by his fiancée, and Emma feels
Knightley’s superiority to Frank. "

Chapters 1–4,"Summary: Chapters 1–2 
 The news that a wealthy young gentleman named Charles
Bingley has rented the manor known as Netherfield Park causes a
great stir in the neighboring village of Longbourn, especially in
the Bennet household. The Bennets have five unmarried daughters,
and Mrs. Bennet, a foolish and fussy gossip, is the sort who agrees
with the novel’s opening words: “It is a truth universally acknowledged,
that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want
of a wife.” She sees Bingley’s arrival as an opportunity for one
of the girls to obtain a wealthy spouse, and she therefore insists
that her husband call on the new arrival immediately. Mr. Bennet
torments his family by pretending to have no interest in doing so,
but he eventually meets with Mr. Bingley without their knowing.
When he reveals to Mrs. Bennet and his daughters that he has made
their new neighbor’s acquaintance, they are overjoyed and excited. Summary: Chapters 3–4 
 Eager to learn more, Mrs. Bennet and the girls question
Mr. Bennet incessantly. A few days later, Mr. Bingley returns the
visit, though he does not meet Mr. Bennet’s daughters. The Bennets
invite him to dinner shortly afterward, but he is called away to
London. Soon, however, he returns to Netherfield Park with his two
sisters, his brother-in-law, and a friend named Darcy. Mr. Bingley and his guests go to a ball in the nearby
town of Meryton. The Bennet sisters attend the ball with their mother.
The eldest daughter, Jane, dances twice with Bingley. Within Elizabeth’s hearing,
Bingley exclaims to Darcy that Jane is “the most beautiful creature”
he has ever beheld. Bingley suggests that Darcy dance with Elizabeth,
but Darcy refuses, saying, “she is tolerable, but not handsome enough
to tempt me.” He proceeds to declare that he has no interest in
women who are “slighted by other men.” Elizabeth takes an immediate
and understandable disliking to Darcy. Because of Darcy’s comments
and refusal to dance with anyone not rich and well bred, the neighborhood
takes a similar dislike; it declares Bingley, on the other hand,
to be quite “amiable.” At the end of the evening, the Bennet women return to
their house, where Mrs. Bennet regales her husband with stories
from the evening until he insists that she be silent. Upstairs,
Jane relates to Elizabeth her surprise that Bingley danced with
her twice, and Elizabeth replies that Jane is unaware of her own
beauty. Both girls agree that Bingley’s sisters are not well-mannered,
but whereas Jane insists that they are charming in close conversation,
Elizabeth continues to harbor a dislike for them. The narrator then provides the reader with Bingley’s background:
he inherited a hundred thousand pounds from his father, but for
now, in spite of his sisters’ complaints, he lives as a tenant. His
friendship with Darcy is “steady,” despite the contrast in their characters,
illustrated in their respective reactions to the Meryton ball. Bingley,
cheerful and sociable, has an excellent time and is taken with Jane;
Darcy, more clever but less tactful, finds the people dull and even
criticizes Jane for smiling too often (Bingley’s sisters, on the
other hand, find Jane to be “a sweet girl,” and Bingley therefore
feels secure in his good opinion of her). Analysis: Chapters 1–4 The opening sentence of  "
Chapters 43–45,"Summary: Chapter 43 
 As Elizabeth tours the beautiful estate of Pemberley with
the Gardiners, she imagines what it would be like to be mistress
there, as Darcy’s wife. The housekeeper, Mrs. Reynolds, shows them
portraits of Darcy and Wickham and relates that Darcy, in his youth, was
“the sweetest, most generous-hearted boy in the world.” She adds
that he is the kindest of masters: “I have never had a cross word from
him in my life.” Elizabeth is surprised to hear such an agreeable
description of a man she considers unbearably arrogant. While Elizabeth and the Gardiners continue to explore
the grounds, Darcy himself suddenly appears. He joins them in their walk,
proving remarkably polite. Elizabeth is immediately embarrassed
at having come to Pemberley after the events of recent months, and
she assures Darcy that she came only because she thought that he
was away. Darcy tells her that he has just arrived to prepare his
home for a group of guests that includes the Bingleys and his own
sister, Georgiana. He asks Elizabeth if she would like to meet Georgiana,
and Elizabeth replies that she would. After Darcy leaves them, the
Gardiners comment on his good looks and good manners, so strikingly
divergent from the account of Darcy’s character that Elizabeth has
given them. Summary: Chapters 44–45 The next day, Darcy and Georgiana, who is pretty but very
shy, visit Elizabeth at her inn. Bingley joins them, and after a
brief visit, they invite Elizabeth and the Gardiners, who perceive
that Darcy is in love with their niece, to dine at Pemberley. The
following morning, Elizabeth and Mrs. Gardiner visit Pemberley to
call on Miss Darcy. Bingley’s sisters are both present; when Darcy
enters the room, Miss Bingley makes a spiteful comment to Elizabeth,
noting that the departure of the militia from Meryton “must be a
great loss to your family.” Elizabeth dodges the subject of Wickham.
This deflection proves fortunate given the presence of Georgiana,
as references to the man with whom she almost eloped would embarrass
her. After the guests depart, Miss Bingley attempts to criticize
Elizabeth to Darcy, and makes a light remark about how he once thought Elizabeth
“rather pretty.” Darcy replies that he now considers Elizabeth “one
of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.” Analysis: Chapters 43–45 Elizabeth’s visit to Pemberley constitutes a critical
step in her progress toward marrying Darcy. The house itself is
representative, even a symbol, of its owner—the narrator describes
it as a “large, handsome, stone building, standing well on rising
ground . . . in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled
into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks were
neither formal, nor falsely adorned.” Darcy is similarly large and
handsome, elevated socially just as his house is elevated physically.
The description of the way the stream’s “natural importance was
swelled into greater” reminds the reader of Darcy’s pride; that
the stream is “neither formal, nor falsely adorned,” however, reminds
the reader of Darcy’s honesty and lack of pretense. Most importantly,
the property delights Elizabeth, foreshadowing her eventual realization
that the master of Pemberley similarly delights her. Mrs. Reynolds’s glowing descriptions of Darcy continue
the process of breaking down Elizabeth’s initial prejudice against
him. As Mrs. Reynolds reveals a hidden side of Darcy, Elizabeth
realizes how hastily she has judged him. This ability to admit the
error of her ways demonstrates Elizabeth’s emotional maturity; unlike
Miss Bingley, who resorts to denigrating Elizabeth when she realizes
that Darcy favors her, Elizabeth does not allow arrogance to prevent
her from confronting her own shortcomings. "
Chapters 13–17,"Summary: Chapters 13–15 The morning after his daughters return from Netherfield,
Mr. Bennet informs his wife of an imminent visit from a Mr. William
Collins, who will inherit Mr. Bennet’s property. Mr. Collins, the
reader learns from a letter he sends to the Bennets, is a clergyman
whom the wealthy noblewoman Lady Catherine de Bourgh has recently selected
to serve her parish. His letter, as Mr. Bennet puts it, contains “a
mixture of servility and self-importance,” and his personality is similar.
He arrives at Longbourn and apologizes for being entitled to the
Bennets’ property but spends much of his time admiring and complimenting
the house that will one day be his. At dinner, Mr. Collins lavishes praise on Lady Catherine
de Bourgh and her daughter, a lovely invalid who will one day inherit the
de Bourgh fortune. After the meal, he is asked to read to the girls, but
he refuses to read a novel and reads from a book of sermons instead.
Lydia becomes so bored that she interrupts his reading with more
gossip about the soldiers. Mr. Collins is offended and abandons
the reading, choosing to play backgammon with Mr. Bennet. Mr. Collins is in search of a wife and when Mrs. Bennet
hints that Jane may soon be engaged, he fixes his attention on Elizabeth.
The day after his arrival, he accompanies the sisters to the town
of Meryton, where they encounter one of Lydia’s officer friends,
Mr. Denny. Denny introduces his friend, Mr. Wickham, who has just
joined the militia, and the young women find Wickham charming. While
they converse, Darcy and Bingley happen by, and Elizabeth notices
that Wickham and Darcy are extremely cold to each other. Darcy and Bingley depart, and the company pays a visit
to Mrs. Phillips, Mrs. Bennet’s sister, who invites the Bennets
and Mr. Collins to dine at her house the following night. The girls
convince her to invite Wickham as well. They return home and Mr.
Collins spends the evening telling Mrs. Bennet how greatly her sister’s
good breeding impresses him. Summary: Chapters 16–17 At the Phillips’s dinner party, Wickham proves the center
of attention and Mr. Collins fades into the background. Eventually,
Wickham and Elizabeth find themselves in conversation, and she hears his
story: he had planned on entering the ministry, rather than the militia,
but was unable to do so because he lacked money. Darcy’s father,
Wickham says, had intended to provide for him, but Darcy used a
loophole in the will to keep the money for himself. Elizabeth, who instinctively likes and trusts Wickham,
accepts his story immediately. Later in the evening, while she is
watching Mr. Collins, Wickham tells her that Darcy is Lady Catherine
de Bourgh’s nephew. He describes Lady Catherine as “dictatorial
and insolent.” Elizabeth leaves the party thinking of nothing “but
Mr. Wickham, and what he had told her, all the way home.” She decides that
Darcy deserves nothing but contempt. "
Chapters 35–42,"Summary: Chapters 35–36 The following day, Elizabeth takes a walk and runs into
Darcy, who gives her a letter. He walks away, and Elizabeth begins
to read it. In the letter, Darcy again admits to attempting to break
Bingley’s romance with Jane, but he defends himself by arguing that
Jane’s attachment to his friend was not yet strong enough to lead
to heartbreak. He adds that he did not wish Bingley to involve himself
with the social encumbrance of marrying into the Bennet family,
with its lack of both wealth and propriety. In relation to Wickham,
the letter states that Darcy did provide for him after his father’s
death and that the root of their quarrel lay in an attempt by Wickham
to elope with Darcy’s sister, Georgiana, in the hopes of obtaining
her fortune. Elizabeth is stunned by this revelation, and while she
dismisses some of what Darcy says about Jane and Bingley, his account
of Wickham’s doings causes her to reappraise the officer and decide that
she was probably wrong to trust him. Her feelings toward Darcy suddenly
enter into flux. Summary: Chapters 37–39 Darcy and Colonel Fitzwilliam leave Rosings. A week later,
Elizabeth departs the parsonage, despite Lady Catherine’s insistence
that she stay another two weeks. Before Elizabeth leaves, Mr. Collins informs
her that he and Charlotte seem to be made for one another (which
is clearly not true). He wishes Elizabeth the same happiness in
marriage that he himself enjoys. After a short stay at the Gardiners’s London house, Elizabeth, joined
by Jane, returns home. The two are met by Catherine and Lydia, who
talk of nothing but the soldiers as they ride home in their father’s
coach. The regiment is to be sent to Brighton for the summer, and
the two girls are hoping to convince their parents to summer there
also. In the course of the conversation, Lydia mentions, with some
satisfaction, that Wickham is no longer interested in Miss King,
who has gone to Liverpool to stay with her uncle. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet welcome their daughters home, and
the Lucases come for dinner. Lydia prattles about the exciting coach ride
and insists that the girls go to Meryton to see the officers. Not wanting
to see Wickham, Elizabeth refuses. Summary: Chapters 40–42 Elizabeth tells Jane the truth about Wickham. They debate
whether to expose him publicly, ultimately deciding against it.
Meanwhile, Mrs. Bennet continues to bemoan the loss of Mr. Bingley
as a husband for Jane and voices her displeasure at the happy marriage
of Charlotte and Mr. Collins. Lydia is invited to spend the summer
in Brighton by the wife of a Colonel Forster. Mr. Bennet allows
her to go, assuming that the colonel will keep her out of trouble. "
Chapters 5–8,"Summary: Chapters 5–6 The Bennets’ neighbors are Sir William Lucas, his wife,
and their children. The eldest of these children, Charlotte, is
Elizabeth’s closest friend. The morning after the ball, the women
of the two families discuss the evening. They decide that while
Bingley danced with Charlotte first, he considered Jane to be the
prettiest of the local girls. The discussion then turns to Mr. Darcy,
and Elizabeth states that she will never dance with him; everyone
agrees that Darcy, despite his family and fortune, is too proud
to be likable. Bingley’s sisters exchange visits with the Bennets and
attempt to befriend Elizabeth and Jane. Meanwhile, Bingley continues
to pay attention to Jane, and Elizabeth decides that her sister
is “in a way to be very much in love” with him but is concealing
it very well. She discusses this with Charlotte Lucas, who comments
that if Jane conceals it too well, Bingley may lose interest. Elizabeth
says it is better for a young woman to be patient until she is sure
of her feelings; Charlotte disagrees, saying that it is best not
to know too much about the faults of one’s future husband. Darcy finds himself attracted to Elizabeth. He begins
listening to her conversations at parties, much to her surprise.
At one party at the Lucas house, Sir William attempts to persuade
Elizabeth and Darcy to dance together, but Elizabeth refuses. Shortly
afterward, Darcy tells Bingley’s unmarried sister that “Miss Elizabeth
Bennet” is now the object of his admiration. Summary: Chapters 7–8 The reader learns that Mr. Bennet’s property is entailed,
meaning that it must pass to a man after Mr. Bennet’s death and
cannot be inherited by any of his daughters. His two youngest children,
Catherine (nicknamed Kitty) and Lydia, entertain themselves by beginning
a series of visits to their mother’s sister, Mrs. Phillips, in the town
of Meryton, and gossiping about the militia stationed there. One night, while the Bennets are discussing the soldiers
over dinner, a note arrives inviting Jane to Netherfield Park for
a day. Mrs. Bennet conspires to send Jane by horse
rather than coach, knowing that it will rain and that Jane will
consequently have to spend the night at Mr. Bingley’s house. Unfortunately,
their plan works out too well: Jane is soaked, falls ill, and is
forced to remain at Netherfield as an invalid. Elizabeth goes to
visit her, hiking over on foot. When she arrives with soaked and
dirty stockings she causes quite a stir and is certain that the
Bingleys hold her in contempt for her soiled clothes. Jane insists
that her sister spend the night, and the Bingleys consent. That night, while Elizabeth visits Jane, the Bingley sisters
poke fun at the Bennets. Darcy and Mr. Bingley defend them, though Darcy
concedes, first, that he would not want his sister ever to go out
on such a walking expedition and, second, that the Bennets’ lack
of wealth and family make them poor marriage prospects. When Elizabeth
returns to the room, the discussion turns to Darcy’s library at
his ancestral home of Pemberley and then to Darcy’s opinions on
what constitutes an “accomplished woman.” After he and Bingley list
the attributes that such a woman would possess, Elizabeth declares
that she “never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and
elegance, as you describe, united,” implying that Darcy is far too
demanding. "
Chapters 24–26,"Summary: Chapters 24–25 Miss Bingley sends another letter, this one praising the
beauty and charm of Darcy’s sister. The letter further states that
Bingley will remain in London all winter, putting an end to the
Bennets’s hopes that he might return to Netherfield. Elizabeth is
very upset by this news and complains to Jane that people lack “merit
or sense,” referring to Bingley for apparently abandoning Jane,
and to Charlotte Lucas for agreeing to marry Mr. Collins. Meanwhile,
Mrs. Bennet’s hopes of seeing her daughters wed fade rapidly. Mr.
Bennet seems amused: he encourages Elizabeth’s interest in Wickham,
so that she, like her sister, can be “crossed in love.” Mrs. Bennet’s brother, Mr. Gardiner, comes to stay with
the family. Immediately recognizing Jane’s sadness, the Gardiners
invite Jane to accompany them back to London when they finish their visit,
hoping that a change in scenery might raise Jane’s spirits. Jane accepts,
excited also that in London she might get an opportunity to see
Mr. Bingley. In the course of evenings spent with various friends and
the military officers, Mrs. Gardiner notices that Elizabeth and Wickham,
though not in any serious sort of love, show a definite preference
for each other. Because of his lack of money, Mrs. Gardiner does
not think of Wickham as a good match for Elizabeth, though she is
fond of Wickham’s stories of his life around Darcy’s estate at Pemberley,
which is near where Mrs. Gardiner grew up. Summary: Chapter 26 At the first opportunity, Mrs. Gardiner warns Elizabeth
that Wickham’s lack of money makes him an unsuitable match. She
further says that Elizabeth should be careful not to embarrass her
father by becoming attached to Wickham. Elizabeth responds carefully,
stating that she will try to keep Wickham from falling in love with
her and that she devoutly wishes not to upset her father, but concluding that
all she can do is her best. After Jane and the Gardiners depart for London, Mr. Collins returns
from a visit to his parish for his wedding. Elizabeth reluctantly
promises to visit Charlotte after her marriage. Meanwhile, Jane’s
letters from London recount how she called on Miss Bingley and how
Miss Bingley was cold to her and visited her only briefly in return.
Jane believes that Bingley’s sister views her as an obstacle to her
brother’s marrying Georgiana Darcy. Mrs. Gardiner writes to Elizabeth to ask about Wickham,
and Elizabeth replies that his attentions have shifted to another
girl, a Miss King, who has just inherited a large fortune. This
turn of events touches Elizabeth’s heart “but slightly . . . and
her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been
his only choice, had fortune permitted it.” The narrator then goes
on to point out that Elizabeth’s equanimity about Wickham trying
to marry for money is somewhat out of joint with her disgust that
Charlotte would do the same thing. As for Elizabeth, the very limited
pain that Wickham’s transfer of affections causes her makes her
believe she was never in love with him. Analysis: Chapters 24–26 The first three chapters of Book Two introduce the Gardiners,
who prove to be Elizabeth’s most sensible relatives. They often
seem to act as surrogate parents to Jane and Elizabeth. The nurturing
and supportive Gardiners take Jane to London to distract her from
her unhappiness over Bingley. However amusing the reader finds him, Mr.
Bennet, in contrast, seems to have no real understanding of when
his children even need help. He prefers withdrawing into the peace
of his library to coping with the problems facing his family. In particular,
Mr. Bennet’s amusement at his wife’s distress and his suggestion
that Elizabeth develop a crush on Wickham emphasize the extent to
which he has abandoned the paternal role in the family. His wit
and intelligence make him a sympathetic character in many ways,
but he seems to absent himself from important matters. Later in
the novel, his negligence allows Lydia to go to Brighton for the summer
and then to elope with Wickham. At this point in the novel, Austen
compels her reader to contrast Mr. Bennet’s unhelpful suggestion
about Wickham with Mrs. Gardiner’s recognition that the officer
is not a suitable match for her niece. "
Chapters 27–34,"Summary: Chapters 27–29 In March, Elizabeth travels with Sir William
Lucas to visit Charlotte and her new husband, Mr. Collins. On the
way, they spend a night in London with Jane and the Gardiners. Elizabeth
and Mrs. Gardiner speak about Wickham’s attempts to win over Miss King.
Mrs. Gardiner is critical of him, calling him a “mercenary,” but
Elizabeth defends him, calling him prudent. Before Elizabeth leaves
London, the Gardiners invite her to accompany them on a tour, perhaps out to the lakes. Elizabeth
gleefully accepts. When Elizabeth arrives in Hunsford, the location
of Mr. Collins’s parish, the clergyman greets her enthusiastically,
as does Charlotte. On the second day of her visit, she sees Miss
de Bourgh, Lady de Bourgh’s daughter, from a window. The girl is “sickly
and cross,” Elizabeth decides, and she imagines with some satisfaction
Darcy’s marrying such an unappealing person. Miss de Bourgh invites
them to dine at Rosings, a mansion that awes even Sir William Lucas
with its grandeur. At dinner, Lady Catherine dominates the conversation.
After the meal, she grills Elizabeth concerning her upbringing,
deciding that the Bennet sisters have been badly reared. The failure
of Mrs. Bennet to hire a governess, the girls’ lack of musical and artistic
talents, and Elizabeth’s own impudence are all mentioned before
the end of the evening. Summary: Chapters 30–32 Sir William departs after a week, satisfied with his daughter’s
contentment. Shortly thereafter, Darcy and a cousin named Colonel Fitzwilliam
visit their aunt at Rosings. When Mr. Collins pays his respects,
the two men accompany him back to his parsonage and visit briefly
with Elizabeth and Charlotte. Another invitation to Rosings follows, and Colonel Fitzwilliam pays
special attention to Elizabeth during the dinner. After the meal, she
plays the pianoforte and pokes fun at Darcy, informing Colonel Fitzwilliam
of his bad behavior at the Meryton ball, at which he refused to
dance with her. Lady Catherine lectures Elizabeth on the proper
manner of playing the instrument, forcing Elizabeth to remain at
the keyboard until the end of the evening. The next day, Darcy visits the parsonage and tells Elizabeth
that Bingley is unlikely to spend much of his time at Netherfield
Park in the future. The rest of their conversation is awkward, and
when Darcy departs, Charlotte declares that he must be in love with
Elizabeth, or he would never have called in such an odd manner.
In the days that follow, both Darcy and his cousin visit frequently,
however, and eventually Charlotte surmises that it is perhaps Colonel Fitzwilliam
who is interested in Elizabeth. "
Chapters 9–12,"Summary: Chapters 9–10 The next day, Mrs. Bennet arrives with Lydia and Catherine
to visit Jane. To Elizabeth’s dismay, Mrs. Bennet spends much of
her visit trying to convince Bingley to remain at Netherfield. During
her stay, Mrs. Bennet makes a general fool of herself, first by
comparing country life to the city and then by prattling on about
Jane’s beauty. Near the end of the visit, fifteen-year-old Lydia
asks Bingley whether he will hold a ball at Netherfield Park. He
replies that he must wait until Jane is fully recovered to hold
a ball. In the evening, Elizabeth observes Miss Bingley piling
compliments upon Darcy as he writes to his sister. The conversation
turns to Bingley’s style of letter writing and then to Bingley’s
impetuous behavior, which entangles Elizabeth and Darcy in an argument
over the virtues of accepting the advice of friends. Afterward,
Miss Bingley plays “a lively Scotch air” on the pianoforte, and
Elizabeth again refuses to dance with Darcy. Her refusal only increases
his admiration, and he considers that “were it not for the inferiority
of her connections, he should be in some danger.” Miss Bingley,
observing his attraction, becomes jealous and spends the following
day making fun of Elizabeth’s family, inviting Darcy to imagine
them connected to his proud and respectable line. That night, Miss Bingley begins reading in imitation of
Darcy—a further attempt to impress him. She chooses her book merely because
it is the second volume of the one that Darcy is reading. Of course,
being uninterested in literature, she is quickly bored and says
loudly, “I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How
much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book!—When I have a
house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent
library.” Summary: Chapters 11–12 Miss Bingley spends the following night in similar fashion,
trying to attract Darcy’s attention: first by reading, then by criticizing
the foolishness of balls, and finally by walking about the room.
Only when she asks Elizabeth to walk with her, however, does Darcy
look up, and then the two women discuss the possibility of finding
something to ridicule in his character. He states that his only
fault is resentment—“my good opinion once lost is lost forever.”
Elizabeth replies that it is hard to laugh at a “propensity to hate
every body,” and Miss Bingley, observing Elizabeth’s monopolization
of Darcy’s attention once again, insists on music. The next morning, Elizabeth writes to her mother to say
that she and Jane are ready to return home. Mrs. Bennet wishes Jane
to stay longer with Bingley, and she refuses to send the carriage.
Elizabeth, anxious to be away, insists on borrowing Bingley’s carriage
and she and her sister leave Netherfield Park. Darcy is glad to
see them go, as Elizabeth attracts him “more than he liked,” considering
her unsuitability as a prospect for matrimony. Analysis: Chapters 9–12 The continuation of Elizabeth’s visit to Netherfield accentuates
the respective attitudes of Miss Bingley and Darcy toward their
guest: jealousy on the part of the former, admiration on that of
the latter. Elizabeth poses a separate threat to each of them. Miss
Bingley fears her as a rival for Darcy’s affection, and Darcy fears
that he will succumb to his growing attraction to her despite the
impracticality of marriage to one of such inferior rank and family.
The anxiety created by class-consciousness thereby becomes a self-perpetuating,
warping institution. Darcy, concerned that he may affect his own
reputation by linking it to the poor reputation of another, tries to
avoid talking to Elizabeth entirely on the final day she spends
at Netherfield. He must tie himself up in a sort of logical knot;
class-consciousness transforms Elizabeth, who is perfect for him,
as something to be feared. Miss Bingley demonstrates how, once a class
system develops, it maintains its coherence. Miss Bingley feels threatened
by Elizabeth and knows she cannot compete with Elizabeth on the
basis of her virtues or talents. Her means of defense is to bring
class-anxiety to bear; by the luck of her birth, Miss Bingley has been
stamped as superior. She now uses the entire social institution of
class to maintain her superiority, even though all logic and experience
show that superiority to be a lie. "
Chapters 18–23,"Summary: Chapter 18 Much to Elizabeth’s dismay, Wickham does not attend the
ball. Mr. Denny tells Elizabeth and Lydia that Darcy’s presence
keeps Wickham away from Netherfield. Elizabeth’s unhappiness increases
during two clumsy dances with Mr. Collins and reaches its peak when she
finds herself dancing with Darcy. Their conversation is awkward,
especially when she mentions Wickham, a subject Darcy clearly wishes
to avoid. At the end of the dance, Elizabeth encounters Miss Bingley,
who warns her not to trust Wickham. Elizabeth assumes that Bingley’s
sister is only being spiteful, however, and chooses to ignore the
warning. Jane then tells her sister that she has asked Bingley for
information about Wickham. But everything Bingley knows about the
officer comes from Darcy and is therefore (in Elizabeth’s mind)
suspect. Mr. Collins, meanwhile, realizes that Darcy is related
to his patroness, Lady Catherine. In spite of Elizabeth’s best attempts
to dissuade him, he introduces himself. Darcy treats Mr. Collins
with contempt, but Mr. Collins is so obtuse that he does not notice. At supper, Mrs. Bennet discusses the hoped-for union of
Bingley and Jane so loudly that Elizabeth criticizes her, noting
that Darcy is listening. Mrs. Bennet, however, ignores Elizabeth
and continues rambling about the impending marriage. At the end
of the meal, Mary performs a terrible song for the company, and
Mr. Collins delivers a speech of epic and absurd pomposity. Elizabeth
feels that her family has completely embarrassed itself. Summary: Chapters 19–21 The next day, Mr. Collins proposes marriage to Elizabeth,
assuming that she will be overjoyed. She turns him down as gently
as possible, but he insists that she will change her mind shortly.
Mrs. Bennet, who regards a match between her daughter and Mr. Collins
as advantageous, is infuriated. She tells Elizabeth that if she
does not marry Mr. Collins she will never see her again, and she
asks Mr. Bennet to order Elizabeth to marry the clergyman. Her husband
refuses and, befitting his wit and his desire to annoy his wife,
actually informs his daughter that if she were to marry Mr. Collins,
he would refuse to see her again. A few days after the refused proposal, Elizabeth encounters Wickham
in Meryton. He apologizes for his absence from the ball and walks
her home, where Elizabeth introduces him to her parents. That same
day, a letter arrives for Jane from Miss Bingley, informing her
that Bingley and his party are returning to the city indefinitely and
implying that Bingley plans to marry Darcy’s sister, Georgiana. Elizabeth
comforts Jane, telling her that this turn of events is all Miss
Bingley’s doing, not her brother’s, and that Bingley will return to
Netherfield. Summary: Chapters 22–23 Suddenly, news arrives that Mr. Collins has
proposed to Charlotte Lucas and that Elizabeth’s friend has accepted.
Elizabeth is shocked, despite Charlotte’s insistence that the match
is the best for which she could hope. Mrs. Bennet, of course, is
furious with her daughter for allowing a husband to escape her,
and as the days go by with no word from Bingley, Jane’s marriage
prospects, too, begin to appear limited. "
Chapters 46–49,"Summary: Chapter 46 When Elizabeth returns to her inn, she finds
two letters from Jane: the first relates that Lydia has eloped with
Wickham, the second that there is no word from the couple and that
they may not be married yet. Elizabeth panics, realizing that if
Wickham does not marry Lydia, the reputations of both Lydia and
the entire family will be ruined. As Elizabeth rushes out to find the Gardiners, Darcy appears
and she tells him the story. Darcy immediately blames himself for
not exposing Wickham, and Elizabeth blames herself for the same
reason. She decides to return home immediately. After an apology
to Darcy and his sister for breaking their dinner engagement, Elizabeth and
the Gardiners hasten back to the Bennet home in Longbourn. Summary: Chapter 47 On the way home, Mr. Gardiner attempts to reassure his
niece that Wickham will certainly marry Lydia because he will not
want his own career and reputation ruined. Elizabeth replies by
telling them generally about Wickham’s past behavior, without revealing
the details of his romance with Darcy’s sister. When she gets home,
Elizabeth learns that her father has gone to London in search of
Lydia and Wickham. Mrs. Bennet, of course, is hysterical, blaming
Colonel Forster for not taking care of her daughter. In private,
Jane assures Elizabeth that there was no way anyone could have known about
their sister’s attachment to Wickham. Fretfully, they examine the
letter that Lydia left for Colonel Forster’s wife, in which she looks
forward to signing her name “Lydia Wickham.” Summary: Chapter 48 Mr. Gardiner follows Mr. Bennet to London and writes to
Longbourn a few days later with the news that the search has been
unsuccessful so far. He reports that Mr. Bennet is now going to
every hotel in turn looking for the couple. Meanwhile, a letter
arrives from Mr. Collins that, in his usual manner, accuses the
Bennets of poor parenting and notes that Lydia’s behavior reflects
poorly on the family as a whole. More time passes before Mr. Gardiner
writes to say that attempts to trace Wickham through friends and
family have failed. The letter further says, to Mrs. Bennet’s consternation,
that Mr. Bennet is returning home. Summary: Chapter 49 Two days after Mr. Bennet returns to Longbourn, Mr. Gardiner writes
to tell him that Wickham and Lydia have been found and that Wickham
will marry her if the Bennets will guarantee him a small income.
Mr. Bennet gladly acquiesces, deciding that marriage to a scoundrel
is better than a ruined reputation. The Bennets assume that the Gardiners have paid Wickham
a sizable amount to get him to agree to the wedding. Not “a farthing
less than ten thousand pounds,” Mr. Bennet guesses. The Bennets assume
that they owe a deep debt to their relatives. Mrs. Bennet is deliriously
happy at having Lydia married, even when her husband and daughters
point out how much it has probably cost. Her happiness is tempered
when her husband refuses to allow Wickham and Lydia to visit or
to provide his newly married daughter with money to purchase clothes. "
Chapters 56–61,"Summary: Chapter 56 A week after Bingley and Jane become engaged, Lady Catherine
de Bourgh visits the Bennets. The noblewoman wants to speak with Elizabeth
and insists that they walk outside to hold a conversation. There,
Lady Catherine informs Elizabeth that she has heard a rumor that
Darcy is planning to marry her. Such a notion, Lady Catherine insists,
is ridiculous, given Elizabeth’s low station in life and the tacit engagement
of Darcy to her own daughter. Elizabeth conceals her surprise at this news and acts
very coolly toward Lady Catherine. She admits that she and Darcy
are not engaged but, despite the noblewoman’s demands, refuses to
promise not to enter into an engagement to him. Lady Catherine claims that
Elizabeth is bound to obey her by “the claims of duty, honour, and
gratitude.” She presents the familiar objection: the Bennets have
such low connections that Darcy’s marrying Elizabeth would “ruin
him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt
of the world.” Elizabeth defends her family, declaring, “I am a
gentleman’s daughter,” and then asserts her independence from the
exasperating control that such snobs as Mr. Collins, Miss Bingley,
and Lady Catherine herself always attempt to exert over their social
inferiors. “I am . . . resolved,” she says, “to act in that manner, which
will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference
to you, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.” Lady Catherine
leaves, furious and frustrated, and Elizabeth keeps their conversation
secret. Summary: Chapters 57–58 
 A short time later, a letter arrives from Mr. Collins
that suggests that an engagement between Darcy and Elizabeth is
imminent. The letter comes to Mr. Bennet, who reads it to Elizabeth
and comments on the absurdity of the idea of an engagement with
Darcy—“who never looked at any woman but to see a blemish, and who
probably never looked at you in his life.” A little while after Lady Catherine’s visit, Darcy again
comes to stay with Bingley at Netherfield. The two friends visit
the Bennets, and everyone takes a walk together. Elizabeth and Darcy
lag behind, and when they are alone, Elizabeth thanks him for his
generosity in saving Lydia’s good name. Darcy replies that he did
so only because Lydia is her sister. He then says that his feelings
toward her have not changed since his proposal. Elizabeth tells
him that her own feelings have changed and that she is now willing
to marry him. Summary: Chapters 59–60 That night, Elizabeth tells Jane about Darcy’s intention
to marry her. Jane, stunned, cannot believe that Elizabeth truly
loves Darcy. Elizabeth promises Jane that she does. The next day,
Darcy and Elizabeth walk together again, and that night Darcy goes
to Mr. Bennet to ask him for his consent to the match. Like Jane, Mr. Bennet needs Elizabeth to convince him
that she does indeed care for Darcy. After she assures him of her
love, she tells him how Darcy paid off Wickham. Mrs. Bennet then
learns of her daughter’s engagement and is actually struck dumb
for a time before bursting into cries of delight. "
Chapters 50–55,"Summary: Chapters 50–51 Elizabeth realizes that her opinion of Darcy has changed
so completely that if he were to propose to her again, she would
accept. She understands, however, that, given Lydia’s embarrassing
behavior and the addition of Wickham to the Bennet family, such
a proposal seems extremely unlikely. Mr. Gardiner writes to Mr. Bennet again to inform him
that Wickham has accepted a commission in the North of England. Lydia
asks to be allowed to visit her family before she goes north with
her new husband. After much disagreement, the Bennets allow the
newlyweds to stay at their home. The ten-day visit is difficult: Lydia
is oblivious to all of the trouble that she has caused, and Wickham
behaves as if he has done nothing wrong. One morning while sitting
with Jane and Elizabeth, Lydia describes her wedding and mentions
that Darcy was in the church. Elizabeth is amazed and sends a letter
to Mrs. Gardiner asking for details. Summary: Chapters 52–53 Mrs. Gardiner replies to Elizabeth that it was Darcy who
found Lydia and Wickham, and Darcy who paid Wickham the money that facilitated
the marriage. She drops hints that Darcy did so because of his love
for Elizabeth. Elizabeth’s surprise is immense, and she is unsure
whether to be upset or pleased. After Wickham and Lydia depart for their new home in the North,
news arrives that Bingley is returning to Netherfield Park for a
few weeks. Mr. Bennet refuses to visit him, much to the family’s discomfort.
Three days after his arrival at Netherfield, however, Bingley comes
to the Bennets’s home, accompanied by Darcy. Mrs. Bennet is overly
attentive to Bingley and quite rude to Darcy, completely unaware
that he was the one who saved Lydia. Before departing, the gentlemen
promise to dine at Longbourn soon. Summary: Chapters 54–55 Darcy and Bingley come to dinner; Bingley places himself
next to Jane and pays her much attention while Darcy finds a seat
at the opposite end of the table from Elizabeth, rendering conversation between
the two impossible. Elizabeth accepts that having been refused by
her once, Darcy will not ask her to marry him again.  Bingley visits the Bennets a few days later, and Mrs.
Bennet invites him to dinner. He tells her that he is already engaged
for the day but eagerly accepts an invitation for the following
day. He calls so early in the morning that he arrives before the
women have gotten dressed. After the meal, Mrs. Bennet manages (clumsily)
to leave Bingley alone with Jane but he does not propose. The following
day, however, Bingley goes shooting with Mr. Bennet and stays for
dinner. After the meal, he finds himself alone with Jane again.
This time, he tells her that he will ask Mr. Bennet for permission
to marry her. Mr. Bennet happily agrees and Jane tells Elizabeth
that she is “the happiest creature in the world.” "
